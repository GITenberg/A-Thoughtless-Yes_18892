      Dedication.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the many strangers who, after reading such of these stories as have
      before been printed, have written me letters that were thoughtful or gay
      or sad, I dedicate this volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters have come from far and near; from rich and from poor; from
      Christian and from unbeliever; from a bishop's palace and from behind
      prison walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this collection of stories shall give to my friends, known and unknown,
      as much pleasure and mental stimulus as their letters gave to me, I shall
      be content.
    </p>

    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In issuing a new edition of this book, it has been thought wise to state
      that an unauthorized edition is now on the market, and it is desirable
      that the public shall know that all copies of this book not bearing the
      imprint of the Commonwealth Company are sold against the will and in
      violation of the rights of the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since some persons have been puzzled to make the connection between the
      title of the book and the stories themselves, and to apply Colonel
      Ingersoll's exquisite autograph sentiment more clearly, a part of "An Open
      Letter," which was written in reply to an editorial review of the book
      when it first appeared, is here reprinted, in the hope that it may remove
      the difficulty for all.

    <h2>
      AN OPEN LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have, this morning, read your review of "A Thoughtless Yes." I wish to
      thank you for the pleasant things said and also to make the connection&mdash;which
      I am surprised to see did not present itself to your mind&mdash;between
      the title and the burden of the stories or sketches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not so easy as you may suppose to get a title which shall be exactly
      and fully descriptive of a collection of tales or sketches, each one of
      which was written to suggest thoughts and questions on some particular
      topic or topics to which people usually pay the tribute of a thoughtless
      yes. With one&mdash;possibly two&mdash;exceptions each sketch means to
      suggest to the reader that there may be a very large question mark put
      after many of the social, religious, economic, medical, journalistic, or
      legal fiats of the present civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that "in 'The Lady of the Club' she [meaning me] does not show how
      poverty results from a thoughtless yes. Perhaps she does not see that it
      does." I had in my mind exactly that point when I wrote the story and when
      I decided upon the title for the book. No, I do not attempt in such
      sketches to show <i>how</i>, but to show <i>that</i>, such and such
      conditions exist and that it is wrong. I want to suggest a question of the
      justice and the right of several things; but I want to leave each person
      free to think out, not my conclusion or remedy, but a conclusion and a
      remedy, and at all events to make him refuse, henceforth, the thoughtless
      yes of timid acquiescence to things as they are simply because they are.
      In the "Lady of the Club" I meant to attack the impudent authority that
      makes such a condition of poverty possible, by calling sympathetic
      attention to its workings. There are one or two other ideas sustained by
      authority, to which, to the readers of that tale, I wished to make a
      thoughtless yes henceforth impossible. At least I hoped to arouse a
      question. One is taxation of church property. I wished to point out that
      by shirking their honest debts churches heap still farther poverty and
      burden upon the poor. I hoped, too, to suggest that the idea of "charity,"
      to which most people give a warmly thoughtless yes, must be an indignity
      or impossibility where, even they would say, it was most needed. I wanted
      to call attention to the fact that a physician and a man of tender heart
      and lofty soul were compelled to make themselves criminals, before the
      law, to even be kind to the dead. That conditions are so savage under the
      present system that such a case is absolutely hopeless while the victims
      live and outrageous after they are dead. To all of these dictates of
      impudent authority, to which most story readers pay the tribute of a
      thoughtless yes, I wanted to call attention in such a way that henceforth
      a question must arise in their minds. I hoped to show, too, that even so
      lofty a character as Roland Barker was tied hand and foot&mdash;until it
      made him almost a madman&mdash;by a system of economics and religion and
      law which so interlace as to sustain each other and combine to not only
      crush the poor but to prevent the rich from helping along even where they
      desire to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the main points upon which that particular tale was intended to
      arouse a mental attitude of thoughtful protest There are other, minor
      ones, which I need not trouble you to recall. If you will notice, nearly
      all of the tales end (or stop without an end) with an open question for
      the reader to settle&mdash;to settle his way, not mine. Indeed, I am not
      yet convinced that my own ideas of the changes needed and the way to bring
      them about are infallible. I am still open to conviction. I have tried to
      grasp the Socialist, Communist, Anarchist, Single-tax, Free-land, and
      other ideas and to comprehend just what each could be fairly expected to
      accomplish if established&mdash;to see the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of
      these and other schemes for social improvement. These, and the varying
      cults ranged between, each seems to me to have certain strong points and
      certain weak ones. Each seems to me to overlook some essential feature;
      and yet I have no system to offer that I think would be better or would
      work better than some of these. Indeed, I do most earnestly believe that
      <i>the</i> inspired way is yet to be struck out, and I do not believe that
      I am the one to do it Meanwhile I can do some things. I can suggest
      questions, and, sometimes, answers. But I am not a god, and I do not want
      all people to answer my way. I do want to help prevent, now and
      henceforth, the tribute of a thoughtless yes from being given to a good
      many established wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since such able thinkers as you are have&mdash;in the main&mdash;already
      refused such tribute, I am perfectly satisfied to let each of these answer
      the questions I have suggested or may suggest in my fiction in the way
      that seems most hopeful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the vast majority of story readers have not yet had their
      emotions touched by the dramatic presentation of "the other side." Fiction
      has&mdash;in the main&mdash;worked to make them accept without question
      all things as authority has presented them. Who knows but that a lofty
      discontent may be stirred in some soul who can solve the awful problems
      and at the same time reconcile the various cults of warring philosophers
      so that they may combine for humanity and cease to divide for revenue&mdash;or
      personal pique? I do not believe that the province of a story is to assume
      to give the solution of philosophical questions that have puzzled and
      proved too much for the best and ablest brains. I have no doubt that
      fiction may stir and arouse to thought many who cannot understand and will
      not heed essays or argument or preaching, while it may also present the
      same thoughts in a new light to those who do. Personally I do not believe
      in tacking on to fiction a "moral" or an "in conclusion" which shall
      switch all such aroused thoughts into one channel. Clear thinking and
      right feeling may lead some one, who is new to such protest, to solutions
      that I have not reached. So let us each question "impudent authority,"
      whether it be in its stupid blindness to heredity or to environment; and I
      shall be content that you solve the new order by an appeal to Anarchism <i>via</i>
      free land; or that Matilda Joslyn Gage solve it by the ballot for women
      and hereditary freedom from slavish instincts stamped upon a race bom of
      superstitious and subject mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally I do not believe that all the free land, free money or freedom
      in the world, which shall leave the mothers of the race (whether in or out
      of marriage) a subject class or in a position to transmit to their
      children the vices or weaknesses of a dominated dependent, will ever
      succeed in populating the world with self-reliant, self-respecting,
      honorable and capable people.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I do not see how the ballot in the hands of woman will
      do for her all that many believe it will. That it is her right and would
      go far is clear; but after that, your question of economics touches her in
      a way that it does not and cannot touch men, and I am free to confess that
      as yet I have heard of no economic or social plan that would not of
      necessity, in my opinion, bear heaviest upon those who are mothers. So you
      will see that when I suggested the desirability in "For the Prosecution"
      of having mothers on the bench and as jurors where a case touched points
      no man living does or can understand in all its phases, I do not think
      that would right all the wrong nor solve all the questions suggested by
      such a trial; but I thought it would help push the car of right and
      justice in the direction of light which we all hope is ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      You believe more in environment than in heredity; I believe in both, and
      that both are sadly and awfully awry, largely because too many people in
      too many ways pay to impudent authority the tribute of a thoughtless yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the saddest things in this world to see the brave and earnest
      men who fight so nobly for better and fairer economic conditions for
      "Labor," pay, much too often, the tribute of a thoughtless yes to the
      absolute pauper status of all womanhood They resent with spirit the idea
      that men should labor for a mere subsistence and always be dependent upon
      and at the financial mercy of the rich. They do not appear to see that to
      one-half of the race even that much economic independence would be a
      tremendous improvement upon her present status. How would Singletax or
      Free-land help this? You may reply that Anarchism would solve that
      problem. Would it? With maternity and physical disabilities in the scale?
      To my mind, all the various economic schemes yet put forward lack an
      essential feature. They provide for a free and better manhood, but they
      pay the tribute of a thoughtless yes to impudent authority in the case of
      womanhood, in many things. And so long as motherhood is serfhood, just so
      long will this world be populated with a race easy to subjugate, weak to
      resist oppression, criminal in its instincts of cruelty toward those in
      its power, and humble and subservient toward authority and domination.
      Character rises but little above its source. The mother molds the man. If
      she have the status, the instincts, and the spirit of a subordinate, she
      will transmit these, and the more enlightened she is the surer is this,
      because of her consciousness of her own degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the Kemmler horror. People all marvel at his "brutish nature and
      his desire to kill." No one says anything about the fact, which was merely
      mentioned at his trial, that his "father was a butcher and his mother
      helped in the business." Did you know that this is also true of Jesse
      Pomeroy; the boy who "from infancy tortured animals and killed whatever he
      could?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Would all this sort of thing mean absolutely nothing to women of the same
      social and scientific status enjoyed by the men who assisted at the trials
      of these two and at the legal murder of one? In ordinary women, of course,
      it would not stir very deep thought But these were not ordinary men. They
      were far more than that, Almost all the women who have spoken or written
      to me of the Kemmler horror have touched that thought Have you heard a man
      discuss it? Is there a reason for this? Do we pay the tribute of a
      thoughtless yes to all that clusters about the present ideas on such
      subjects and about their criminal medicolegal aspects? But this letter
      grows too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      With great respect and hearty good wishes,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sincerely,
    </p>

      <i>"We look at the one little woman's face we lovey as we look at the face

      "But after all it is not fair to blame her as you do, Cuthbert. She is
      what she must be. It is not at all strange. Midge&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite out of patience with you, Nora;" exclaimed Cuthbert Wagner,
      vehemently. "How can you excuse her? Midge, as you call her, has been no
      friend to you. She was deceitful and designing all along. She even tried
      in every way she could think of to undermine you in <i>my</i> affections!"
      He tossed his head contemptuously and strode to the window where he stood
      glaring out into the moonlight in fierce and indignant protest. His wife
      had so often spoken well of Margaret Mintem. She did not appear to hold
      the least resentment toward the school-friend of her past years, while
      Cuthbert could see nothing whatever that was good or deserving of praise
      in the character of the young lady in question. He was bitterly resentful
      because Margaret Mintem had spoken ill of his wife while she was only his
      betrothed, and Cuthbert Wagner did not forgive easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora crossed the room with her swift, graceful tread, and the sweep of her
      lace gown over the thick rug had not reached her husband's ear as he stood
      thumping on the window pane. He started a little, therefore, when a soft
      hand was laid upon his arm and a softer face pressed itself close to his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very sweet of you, dear," she said in her low, gentle voice, "It is
      very sweet of you to feel so keenly any thrust made at me; but darling,
      you are unfair to Midge, poor girl! My heart used often to bleed for her.
      It must be terribly hard for her to fight her own nature, as she does,&mdash;as
      she <i>must</i>,&mdash;and lose the battle so often after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fight fiddle-sticks!" said Cuthbert, and then went on grumbling in
      inarticulate sounds, at which his wife laughed out merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, boo, boo, boo," she said, pretending to imitate his unuttered words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe a word of it. <i>I know Margaret Mintern</i>. Did I not
      room with her for three long years? And do I not know that she is a good
      girl, and a very noble one, too, in spite of her little weakness of envy
      or jealousy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can't help that. I am sure she must be terribly humiliated by it.
      Indeed, indeed, dear, I know that she is; but she cannot master it. It is
      a part of her. I do not know whether she was bom with it or not; but I do
      know that all of her life since she was a very little girl she has been so
      situated that just that particular defect in her character is the
      inevitable result. Don't you believe, Cuthbert, that all such things are
      natural productions? Why, dearie, it seems to me that you might as
      reasonably feel angry with me because my hair is brown as toward Midge
      because her envy sometimes overbears her better qualities. The real fault
      lies&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Nora, suppose you take the stump! Lecture on 'Whatever is is right,'
      and have done with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha, my dear," laughed his wife, "I have caught you napping again. I do
      not say that it is right; but I do say that it is natural for Margaret to
      be just what she is. That is just the point people always overlook, it
      seems to me. Nature is wrong about half of the time&mdash;even inanimate
      nature. Just look over there! See those splendid mountains and the lovely
      little valley all touched with moonlight; but, oh, how the eye longs for
      water! A lake, a splendid river, the ocean in the distance&mdash;something
      that is water&mdash;<i>anything</i> that is water! But no, it is valley
      and mountain and mountain and valley, until the most beautiful spot in the
      world, when first you see it, grows hateful and tiresome and lacking in
      the most important feature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuthbert laughed. "A lake would look well just over there by McGuire's
      barn, now, wouldn't it? And, come to think of it, how a few mountains
      would improve things over at Newport or Long Beach." He stopped to thump a
      bug from his wife's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How pretty you look in that black lace, little woman. I don't believe
      nature needed any improver once in her life anyhow&mdash;when she made
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora smiled. A pleased, gratified little dimple made itself visible at one
      corner of her mouth. Her husband stooped over and kissed it lightly, just
      as the portiere was drawn aside and a guest announced by James, the
      immaculate butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've just been having a quarrel, Bailey," said Mr. Wagner, as he
      advanced to greet the visitor, "and now I mean to leave it to you if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," drawled Mr. Bailey, "I noticed that as I came in. You were just
      punctuating your quarrel as James drew back the portiere. That is the
      reason I coughed so violently as I stepped inside. Don't be alarmed about
      my health. It isn't consumption. It is only assumption, I do assure you. I
      assumed that you assumed that you were alone&mdash;that there wasn't an
      interested spectator; but, great Scott! Bert, I don't blame you, so don't
      apologize;" and with a low bow of admiration to his friend's wife, he
      joined in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what was the row? I'm consumed to hear it," he added, as they were
      seated. "I should be charmed to umpire the matter&mdash;so long as it
      ended that way. Now, go on; but I want to give you fair warning, old man,
      that I am on Mrs. Wagner's side to start with, so you fire off your
      biggest guns and don't attempt to roll any twisted balls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Curved</i> balls," laughed Nora, "not twisted; and it seems to me you
      mixed your games just a wee bit. There isn't any game with guns and balls
      both, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, yes indeed," replied Mr. Bailey, promptly. "The old, old game in
      which there is brought to bear a battery of eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't," said Cuthbert. "I am not equal to it! But after all, I can't
      see that you are well out of this, Ned. Where do the balls come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you against eyeballs that roll in a fine frenzy when a battery
      of handsome eyes is trained upon a bashful fellow like me?" he asked quite
      gravely, and then all three laughed and Cuthbert pretended to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall really have to protest, myself, if you go any farther, Mr.
      Bailey," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are getting into deep water, and if you are to be on my side in the
      coming contest, I want you to have a cool head and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clean heart;" put in Cuthbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Wagner never asks for impossibilities, I am sure," said Mr. Bailey,
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she does. That is just it. She wants to make me believe that a girl
      who traduced her and acted like a little fiend generally, is an adorable
      creature&mdash;a natural production which couldn't help itself&mdash;had
      to behave that way. We&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I started in by saying that I should be on your side, Mrs.
      Wagner," said their guest, assuming a judicial attitude and bracing
      himself behind an imaginary pile of accumulated evidence, "but I'm
      beginning to wobble already. If Bert makes another home run like that, I
      warn you, madam, that while I shall endeavor to be a fair and impartial
      judge, I shall decide against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora's eyes had a twinkle in their depths for an instant, but her face had
      grown grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait. Let me tell you." she said. "Even Cuthbert does not know just how
      it was&mdash;what went to make my old school-friend's character precisely
      what it became. It was like this: When she was a very little girl her
      father died, and the poor little mother went back home with her four young
      children, and her crushed pride, to be an additional burden to the already
      overburdened father, who was growing old and who had small children of his
      own still to educate and pilot through society. He had lost his hold on
      business when he went into the army; and although he came home a general,
      quite covered with glory, a large family cannot live on glory, you know,
      and fame will not buy party dresses for three daughters and a grandchild."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've noticed that," remarked Mr. Bailey, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The added importance of his position and the consequent publicity made
      the handsome party gowns all the more necessary, however," said Nora, not
      heeding the interruption, "and so the family had to do a great many things
      that were not pleasant to make even one end meet, as poor Midge used to
      say. The General loved brains and his granddaughter was very bright."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuthbert gave a low whistle. He would not compromise. If he found one
      thing wrong in an acquaintance all things were wrong. It followed,
      therefore, in his mind, that since Margaret Min-tern had been guilty of
      envy, she was altogether unlikely to possess fine mental capabilities. He
      would not even allow that she was stylish and sang well.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife took no notice of his outburst, but her color deepened a little
      as she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was the most clever girl mentally that I have ever known and she was
      a vast deal of service to me in the years we were together. She sharpened
      my wits and stimulated my thoughts in a thousand ways, for which I am her
      debtor still. But I am getting ahead of my story. As I say, the old
      General worshipped brains, but he also adored beauty; and, alas, his
      granddaughter was quite plain&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugly as a hedge-fence, and I never could see that she was so superhumanly
      brilliant or stylish, as you claim, either," put in Cuthbert Wagner, as he
      leaned back in his deep chair with his eyes drawn to a narrow line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was almost exactly the same age of her Aunt Julia, the General's
      youngest daughter; but Julia was a dream of beauty and of stupidity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Situation is now quite plain," said Mr. Bailey. "The lovely Julie got
      there. She always does, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you must remember that in this case 'there' was the heart of the
      father of one and the grandfather of the other," said Nora, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband laughed outright and faced Mr. Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather think she has got you now, old man. In a case like that I'm
      hanged if I know how it would turn out&mdash;who would get there. The
      elements won't mix. It is not the usual thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beautiful stupid and the brilliant but plain are all right,&mdash;regular
      stage properties, so to speak,&mdash;but the grandfather! I'll wager if we
      tossed up for it, and you got heads and I got tails we'd both be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something actually uncanny in the aged grandparent ingredient in
      a conundrum like that. Now if it were a young fellow,&mdash;only the
      average donkey,&mdash;why of course the lovely Julia would bear off the
      palm and leave Midge, as Nora calls her, to pine away. But if it were a
      level-headed, middle-aged chap like me, brains would take precedence." He
      waved his hand lightly toward his wife, who parted her lips over a set of
      little white teeth and a radiant smile burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a bold hypocrite, Bert," said Mr. Bailey. "You did not have to
      make any such choice, and you are not entitled to the least credit in the
      premises. You got both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is really quite overwhelming," laughed Nora; "but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why on earth did you call her attention to it, Ned," exclaimed Mr.
      Wagner, with great pretence of annoyance. "She would have swallowed it
      whole. I wonder why it is a woman so loves to be told that you married her
      for her intellect, when in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of eight
      hundred and forty you did nothing of the kind, and she knows it perfectly
      well. You married her because you loved her, brains or no brains, beauty
      or no beauty, and that's an end of it. Isn't that so, Ned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm not prepared to say, yet. I am umpire. I have not made up my
      mind which I shall marry&mdash;the lovely Julia, or the brilliant niece;
      but I think I shall in the long run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God help you if you do!" said Cuthbert, dramatically. "I don't know
      Julia, the beautiful; but I'd hate to see you married to a cat with uncut
      claws, Ned, much as I think you need dressing down from time to time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Wagner," said Mr. Bailey, turning to her, gravely, "I'm not paying
      the least attention to him, and I am eager to hear how the grandfather got
      out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>grandfather!</i>" exclaimed Nora, "why I had no idea of telling
      his story. It was the two girls I was interested in&mdash;or at least, in
      one of them; but that is just like a man. He&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed her feather fan to fall in her lap and looked up helplessly.
      "But come to think of the other side, his story <i>would</i> be worth
      telling, wouldn't it? It must have been a rather trying situation for him,
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the fan up again, and waved it before her, thoughtfully. "I
      wonder why I never thought of that before. I have always rather blamed him
      for developing his granddaughter's one sad defect. I thought he should
      have guarded her against it. And&mdash;I do wonder if it is because I am a
      woman that I never before thought how very difficult it must have been for
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, no doubt," said her husband, dryly. "But now that we have shed
      a few tears over our mental shortcomings and lack of breadth of sympathy
      in overlooking the sad predicament of the doughty General, proceed. The
      umpire sleepeth apace, and I've got to have my shy at the charming Midge
      before we've done with her," and he shut his paper-knife with a wicked
      little click.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can see how it would be," Nora began again, quite gravely, and the
      gentlemen both smiled. "You can see how it would be. The granddaughter was
      made to feel that she was in the way&mdash;was a burden. Her mother would
      urge her to become indispensable to the old General. To read to him, talk
      brightly to him, sing and play for him, watch his moods and meet them
      cleverly. It was all done as a race for his affections. Julia raced with
      her, setting her beauty and the other great fact that she was the child of
      his old age over against the entertaining qualities of her rival."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bailey drew his handkerchief across his brow and looked helplessly
      perplexed, while Cuthbert responded with a dreary shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a clear case of 'The Lady or the Tiger,' yet, so far as I can see,"
      said he. "Who got there, Bailey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bailey smiled despairingly, and shook his head, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It went on like that day after day, week after week, month after month,
      year after year," continued Nora, looking steadily in front of her and
      shivering a little, "until they were both young ladies. The General gave a
      party to present them both to society at the same time. His granddaughter
      tried to make him feel that he was repaid for the expense and trouble by
      the display of her exceptional powers as a conversationalist&mdash;Julia,
      by the display of her neck and shoulders, her exquisite rose-leaf face,
      and her childishly pretty manners. This sort of rivalry would have been
      well enough, no doubt, if it had not been for the fact that from childhood
      up to this culmination there had been a dash of bitterness in it, an
      un-der-current of antagonism; and poor Midge had always been the main
      sufferer, because she was very sensitive and she was made to feel that all
      she received was taken from her aunt Julia. To stand first with her
      father, Julia would do almost anything; and the ingenuity with which she
      devised cruel little stabs at Midge was simply phenomenal. To be
      absolutely necessary to him became almost a mania with his granddaughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this thing goes on much longer, I am going to have a fit," Cuthbert
      announced, placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl you judge so harshly, poor child, had a great many of them,"
      said Nora, with an inflection in her voice that checked a laugh on Mr.
      Bailey's lips. "Fits of depression, fits of anger, fits of sorrow, fits of
      shame and of indignation with herself and with others. For there were
      times when she stooped to little meannesses which her sensitive soul
      abhorred. If intense effort resulted, after all, in failure, envy of her
      successful rival grew up in her heart; and, sometimes, if it were
      carefully cultivated by the pruning hook of sarcasm or an unkind look of
      triumph, she would say or do a mean or underhand thing, and then regret it
      passionately when it was too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuthbert gave a grunt of utter incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Regretted it so little she'd do it again next day," he grumbled. Nora
      went steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It grew to be the one spring and impulse of her whole nature&mdash;the
      necessity of her existence&mdash;to stand <i>first</i> with the ruling
      spirit wherever she was, whoever it might be. At school I have known her
      to sit up all night to make sure that she would be letter-perfect in her
      lessons the following morning. Not because she cared for her studies so
      much as because she <i>must</i> feel that she stood first in the
      estimation of her teachers. And then, too, her grandfather would know and
      be proud of her. It got to be nature with her (I do not know how much of
      the tendency may have been born in her) to need to stand on the top
      wherever she was. (It has always seemed to me that the conditions
      surrounding her were quite enough to explain this characteristic without
      an appeal to a possible heredity of which I can know nothing.) Even where
      we boarded, although she disliked the women and looked down upon the young
      men, she made them all like her, and even went the length of allowing one
      young fellow to ask her to marry him simply because she saw that he was
      interested in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! She&mdash;" began Cuthbert, but his wife held up her hand to check
      him, and did not pause in her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up to that time she had not given him a thought, and she was very angry
      when he finally asked the great question. She thought that he should have
      known that such a girl as she was could not be for a man of his
      limitations. She felt insulted. She flew up stairs and cried with
      indignation. 'The mere idea!' she said to me. 'How dared he! The common
      little biped!' I told her that she had encouraged him, and had brought
      unnecessary pain upon him as well as regret upon herself. Then she was
      angry with me. By and by she put her hand out in the darkness and took
      mine and pressed it. Then she said, 'Nora, it <i>was</i> my fault; but&mdash;but&mdash;'
      and then she began to sob again. 'But, Nora, I don't&mdash;know&mdash;why&mdash;I&mdash;did&mdash;it&mdash;and,'
      there was a long pause. 'And, beside, I <i>thought</i> he was in love with
      you,'" she sobbed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was the whole story," said Cuthbert, resentfully. "She simply wanted
      to supplant you and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that <i>was</i> the whole story, as you say, dear," said his wife,
      gently; "but the poor girl could not help it. And&mdash;and she did not
      understand it herself at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me provoked, Nora," said Cuthbert, almost sharply. "She wasn't a
      fool. She tried the same game on me a year or two later; but that time it
      didn't work. She even went the length of talking ill of you to me&mdash;saying
      little cutting things&mdash;when she found I had utterly succumbed to your
      attractions. I have to laugh yet when I think of it,&mdash;that is, when
      it don't make me too angry to laugh,&mdash;how I gave her a good round
      talking to." He laughed now at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must have taken me for her delightful old grandparent the way I
      lectured her. But when I remembered how loyal you were to her, it just
      made my blood boil and I told her so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bailey shifted his position and began to contemplate giving a verdict
      emphatically against the absent lady, when Nora checked him by a wave of
      her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know she did, Cuthbert, and I know everything you said to her. You
      were very cruel&mdash;if you had understood, as you did not and do not
      yet. She came and told me all about it." Cuthbert Wagner gave a low,
      incredulous whistle, and even Mr. Bailey looked sceptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She came back from that drive with you the most wretched girl you ever
      saw. Her humiliation was pitiful to see. Her self-reproach was touching
      and real. I believe she would have killed herself if I had seemed to blame
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuthbert snapped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! Very likely; and gone and done the same thing again the next day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly that is true&mdash;if there had been a next day with a new
      temptation that was too strong for her on the shore where she landed after
      death If&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Almighty had shown a preference for some one else, hey?" asked Mr.
      Bailey, flippantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, no doubt," acquiesced Nora. "But suppose you had a weak leg and
      it gave way at a critical moment&mdash;say just when you were entering an
      opera box to greet a lady. Suppose it dropped you in a ridiculous or
      humiliating manner. You would rage and be distressed, and make up your
      mind not to let it occur again, except in the seclusion of your own
      apartments; but&mdash;well, it would be quite as likely to serve you the
      same trick the following week, in church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The illustration does not strike me as quite fair," said Mr. Bailey,
      judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, Ned! Don't let her argue you into an interest in that little cat.
      She was simply a malicious little&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, then," said Nora, ignoring her husband's outburst and looking
      steadily at Margaret Mintem's new judge, who was showing signs of passing
      a sentence no less severe than if it were delivered by Cuthbert Wagner
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose we take your memory. Are there not some names or dates that <i>will</i>
      drop out at times and leave you awkwardly in the lurch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, rather," said Mr. Bailey, disgustedly. This was his weak spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't you see that a person who has a perfect memory might be as
      unfair to you as you are to my old school friend in her little moral
      weakness&mdash;if we may call it by so harsh a term as that? That was her
      one vulnerable spot. It may have been born in her. That I do not know; but
      I insist that it <i>was</i> trained and drilled into her as much as her
      arithmetic or her catechism were, and with a result as inevitable. She
      loathed her fault, but it was too strong for her. Her resolution to
      conquer it dropped just short of success very often, indeed; and oh! how
      it did hurt her when she realized it and thought it all over, for her
      motives were unusually pure, and her moral sense was really very high
      indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moral sense was a little frayed at the edges, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Cuthbert. You are such a cruelly severe judge. I know Mr. Bailey
      is on my side, now, and will think you very unfair. He does not mean to
      be, I assure you, Mr. Bailey, and if she had not spoken ill of me he would
      see the case fairly. But what <i>are</i> you thinking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That it is a rather big question. That I&mdash;that I have overstayed my
      time. I just came over to ask you to dine with us next Thursday. My mother
      has some friends and wants you to meet them. May I leave my judicial
      decision open until then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Pray over it," said Cuthbert, rising; "and if you don't come
      out on my side, openly,&mdash;as I know you are in your mind,&mdash;buy a
      wire mask. I won't have any dodging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come early. There is a secret to tell," laughed Mr. Bailey as he
      withdrew, and then he blushed furiously. "Mother's secret," he added, as
      he closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the dinner the Wagners were later than they had intended to
      be, and Mrs. Bailey took Nora aside and said quite abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to pop it at you rather suddenly. Why didn't you come earlier?
      The lady whom Ned is to marry is here, and it is for her I have given the
      dinner. Ned went to your house to tell you last week, but his heart failed
      him. He said you were all in such a gale of nonsense that he concluded to
      wait. It is a very tender subject with him, I assure you. His case is
      quite hopeless. He is madly in love, and I am very much pleased with his
      choice. She seems as nearly perfect as they ever are, and she is unusually
      talented. But here is Ned now. I have told her all about it, my son, come
      and be congratulated."
    </p>
    <p>
      He came forward shyly enough for a man of his years and experience, and
      took Nora's hand in a helpless way. But Cuthbert relieved matters at once
      by a hearty "Well, it is splendid, old fellow. I'm delighted. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But before the others come down," broke in Mr. Bailey, as if to get away
      from the subject, "I want to get my discharge papers in that case you
      plead before me last week. It lies heavy on my soul, for I am very sorry
      to say, Mrs. Wagner, that I am compelled to give judgment against you and
      your client. I think she was&mdash;I'm with Cuthbert this time. She
      impresses me as almost without redeeming qualities. I do not wish to make
      her acquaintance. I am sure that I could never force myself to take even a
      passing interest in that sort of a moral acrobat. Really, the lovely but
      selfish Julia would be my choice in a team of vicious little pacers like
      that. I'm sure I should detect your friend's fatal weakness in her every
      action. I should be unable to see anything but the hideous green-eyed
      monster even in the folds of her lace gowns or the coils of her shining
      hair. He would appear to me, ghost-like, peering over her shoulder in the
      midst of her most fascinating conversation. I should feel his fangs and
      see the glitter of his wicked eyes while I tried to say small nothings to
      her, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not at all," protested Nora. "You would never detect it at all unless
      she happened to be fighting for your esteem or admiration where she felt
      that odds were against her. She&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Wagner, but I am quite sure that I should. Envy
      is to me the very worst trait in the human character. I could more easily
      excuse or be blinded to anything else. I <i>know</i> that I should detect
      it at once. I always do&mdash;especially in a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Anybody could. You know very well, Nora, that I saw&mdash;"
      began Cuthbert quite gleefully; but as a salve to her wounded feelings Mr.
      Bailey added in a tone of conciliation to Nora:
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, I shall agree to let you test me some day. Present your friend
      to me, <i>incog.</i>, and I'll wager&mdash;oh, <i>anything</i> that I
      shall read her like a book on sight. I'm a splendid judge of a woman.
      Always was from childhood. I'm sure that I should feel creepy the moment I
      saw the brilliant but envious granddaughter of the unfortunate old
      warrior. And by the way, <i>he</i> continues to be the one for whom you
      have enlisted my sympathy. I wonder that he was able to live two weeks in
      the same house with such a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cat," said Cuthbert, with a vicious jab at a paper-weight which
      represented a solemn-looking Chinese god in brocade trousers. He was just
      turning to enter into a cheerful and elaborate statement of his side of
      the controversy, as Mrs. Bailey swept down the room with her son's
      betrothed upon her arm, smiling and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Margaret Mintern!" exclaimed Nora, in dismay, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad to see you again, dear, and to be able to congratulate you,
      instead of some fair unknown, upon the fact that you are to have so dear a
      friend of ours for a husband. We think everything of Mr. Bailey. He is
      Bert's best friend and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuthbert had turned half away in utter confusion when he saw the ladies
      coming down the room, and feigned an absorption in the rotund Chinese
      deity which he had never displayed for the one of his own nation. But he
      bowed now, and mumbled some inarticulate sounds as he looked, not at the
      future Mrs. Bailey, but at the ridiculously happy face of her lover, whose
      usually ready tongue was silent as he hung upon the lightest tone of the
      brilliant woman beside him. As they passed into the dining-room, Nora
      managed to say to her husband:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank heaven we did not mention her name to him, and he evidently does
      not suspect. Pull yourself together and stumble through your part the best
      you can, dear, without attracting his attention. And then you know that he
      and you agree perfectly about the&mdash;cat," she added wickedly, and then
      she smiled quietly as she took her seat next to the blissful lover and the
      relentless judge of the school friend of her youth.

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The old and somewhat cynical saying, that philosophers and reformers can
      bear the griefs and woes of other people with a heroism and resignation
      worthy of their creeds, would have fitted the case of Roland Barker only
      when shorn of the intentional sting of sarcasm. It is, nevertheless, true
      that even his nobly-gifted nature, his tender heart, and his alert brain
      sometimes failed to grasp the very pith and point of his own arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a wealthy man whose sympathies were earnestly with the poor and
      unfortunate. He believed that he understood their sufferings, their
      ambitions, and their needs; and his voice and pen were no more truly on
      the side of charity and brotherly kindness than was his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no unusual thing for him to attend a meeting, address a club, or
      take part in a memorial service, where his was the only hand unused to
      toil, and where he alone bore all expense, and then&mdash;after dressing
      himself in the most approved and faultless manner&mdash;become the guest
      of honor at some fashionable entertainment. Indeed, he was a leader in
      fashion as well as in philosophy, and at once a hero in Avenue A and on
      Murray Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of which I am about to tell you he had addressed a club of
      workingmen in their little dingy hall, taking as his subject "Realities of
      Life." He had sought to show them that poverty and toil are not, after
      all, the worst that can befall a man, and that the most acute misery
      dwells in palaces and is robed in purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the feeling of one who had himself suffered&mdash;as,
      indeed, he had&mdash;from the unsympathetic associations of an uncongenial
      marriage. He portrayed, with deep feeling, the chill atmosphere of a
      loveless home, whose wealth and glitter and lustre could never thrill and
      enrapture the heart as might the loving hand-clasp in the bare, chill
      rooms where sympathy and affection were the companions of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had admired his enthusiasm as he pictured the joy of sacrifice for the
      sake of those we love, and I had been deeply touched by his pathos&mdash;a
      pathos which I knew, alas, too well, sprang from a hungry heart&mdash;whether,
      as now, it beat beneath a simple coat of tweed or, as when hours later, it
      would still be the prisoner of its mighty longing, though clothed with
      elegance and seated at a banquet fit for princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words fell slowly from his lips, and his eyes were dimmed, as
      were the eyes of all about me. His voice, so full of feeling, had hardly
      ceased to throb when, far back in the little hall, arose a woman, thin and
      worn, and plainly clad, but showing traces of a beauty and refinement
      which had held their own and fought their way inch by inch in spite of
      poverty, anxiety, and tears. The chairman recognized her and asked her to
      the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, in a low, tremulous tone which showed at once her feeling
      and her culture&mdash;"no, I do not wish to take the platform; but since
      you ask for criticism of the kind speech we have just listened to, it has
      seemed to me that I might offer one, although I am a stranger to you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled, and she held firmly to the back of a chair in front of
      her. The chairman signified his willingness to extend to her the privilege
      of the floor, and there was slight applause. She bowed and began again
      slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sometimes think that it is useless to ever try to make the suffering
      rich and the suffering poor understand each other. I do not question that
      the gentleman has tasted sorrow. All good men have. I do not question that
      his heart is warm and true and honest, and that he truly thinks what he
      has said; but"&mdash;and here her voice broke a little and her lip
      trembled&mdash;"but he does not know what real suffering is. He cannot. No
      rich man can." There was a movement of impatience in the room, and some
      one said, loud enough to be heard, "If she thinks money can bring
      happiness she is badly left."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight ripple of laughter at this, and even the serious face
      of Roland Barker grew almost merry for a moment. Then the woman went on,
      without appearing to have noticed the interruption:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not want to seem ungracious, and heaven knows, no one could mean
      more kindly what I say; but he has said that money is not needed to make
      us happy&mdash;only love; and again he quotes that baseless old maxim,
      'The love of money is the root of all evil.'" She paused, then went slowly
      on as if feeling her way and fearing to lose her hold upon herself: "I
      know it is a sad and cruel world even to the more fortunate, if they have
      hearts to feel and brains to think. To the unloving or unloved there must
      be little worth; but they at least are spared the agony that sits where
      love and poverty have shaken hands with death"&mdash;her voice broke, and
      there was a painful silence in the room&mdash;"where those who love are
      wrung and torn by all the thousand fears and apprehensions of ills that
      are to come to wife and child and friend. The day has passed when all this
      talk of poverty and love&mdash;that love makes want an easy thing to bear&mdash;the
      day has passed, I say, when sane men ought to think, or wise men speak,
      such cruel, false, and harmful words. He truly says that money without
      love cannot bring happiness; but that is only half the truth, for love
      with poverty can bring, does bring, the keenest agony that mortals ever
      bore."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement of dissent in the hall. She lifted her face a moment,
      contracted her lips, drew a long breath, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will explain. Without the love, poverty were light enough to bear. What
      does it matter for one's self? It is the love that gives the awful sting
      to want, and makes its cruel fingers grip the throat as never vise or
      grappling-hook took hold, and torture with a keener zest than fiends their
      victims! Love and Poverty! <i>It is the combination that devils invented
      to make a hell on earth.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were fastened on her white face now, and she was rushing on, her
      words, hot and impassioned, striking firm on every point she made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me give you a case. In a home where comfort is&mdash;or wealth&mdash;a
      mother sits, watching by night and day the awful hand of Death reach
      nearer, closer to her precious babe, and nothing that skill or science can
      suggest will stay the hand or heal the aching heart; and yet there is
      comfort in the thought that all was done that love and wealth and skill
      could do, and that it was Nature's way. But take from her the comfort of
      that thought. She watches with the same poor, breaking heart, but with the
      knowledge, now, to keep her company, that science might, ah! <i>could</i>,
      push back the end, could even cure her babe if but the means to pay for
      skill and change and wholesome food and air were hers. Is that no added
      pang? Is poverty no curse to her?&mdash;a curse the deeper for her depth
      of love? The rich know naught of this. It gives to life its wildest agony,
      to love its deepest hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. There was a slight stir as if some one had thought to offer
      applause, and then the silence fell again, and she began anew, with
      shining eyes and cheeks aflame. She swayed a little as she spoke and
      clutched the chair as for support. Her voice grew hoarse, and trembled,
      and she fixed her gaze upon a vacant chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But let me tell you of another case. A stone's throw from this hall,
      where pretty things are said week after week&mdash;and kindly meant, I
      know&mdash;of poverty and love&mdash;of the blessedness of these&mdash;there
      is a living illustration, worth more than all the theories ever spun, to
      tell you what 'realities of life' must be where love is great and poverty
      holds sway. Picture, with me, the torture and despair of a refined and
      cultured woman who watches hour by hour the long months through, and sees
      the creeping feet of mental wreck, and physical decay, and knows the
      mortal need of care and calm for him who is the whole of life to her, and
      for the want of that which others waste and hold as dross he must work on
      and on, hastening each day the end <i>he</i> does not see, which shall
      deprive him of all of life except the power for ill.... She will be worse
      than widowed and alone, for ever by her side sits Want, for him, tearing
      at every chord of heart and soul&mdash;not for herself&mdash;but for that
      dearer one, wrecked in the prime of life and left a clod endowed only with
      strength for cruel wrong, whose hand would sheath a knife in her dear
      heart and laugh with maniac glee at his mad deeds. She saw the end. She
      knew long months ago what was to be, if he must toil and strain his nerve
      and brain for need of that which goes from knave to knave, and hoards
      itself within cathedral walls, where wise men meet to teach the poor
      contentment with their lot! She knew <i>he</i> must not know; the
      knowledge of the shadow must be kept from <i>his</i> dear brain until the
      very end, by smiles, and cheer, and merry jest from her. Who dare tell <i>her</i>
      that riches are a curse? and prate of 'dross' and call on heaven to
      witness that its loss is only gain of joy and harbinger of higher, holier
      things? Who dare call <i>her</i> as witness for the bliss of poverty with
      love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly raised her hand and, with a quick-drawn breath, pressed it
      against her side, and with her eyes still fastened on the vacant chair,
      and tears upon her cheeks, falling unchecked upon her heaving bosom, she
      held each listener silent and intent on every word she spoke. The time
      allotted anyone was long since overrun; but no one thought of that, and
      she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'With love!' Ah, there is where the iron can burn and scar and open every
      wound afresh each day, make poverty a curse, a blight, a scourge, a
      vulture, iron-beaked, with claws of burning steel, that leave no nerve
      untouched, no drop of blood unshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'With love!' 'Tis there the hand of Poverty can deal the deadliest blows,
      and show, as nowhere else on earth, the value of that slandered, hoarded
      thing called wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      There blazed into her face a fierce, indignant light, her voice swelled
      out and struck upon the ear like fire-bells in the dead of night:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The root of evil!'&mdash;'poverty with love!' Hypocrisy, in purple
      velvet robed, behind stained glass, with strains of music falling on its
      ears, with table spread in banquet-hall below, bethought itself to argue
      thus to those itself had robbed; while, thoughtless of its meaning and its
      birth, the echo of its lying, treacherous words comes from the pallid lips
      of many a wretch whose life has been a failure and an agony because of
      that which he himself extols. A lie once born contains a thousand lives,
      and holds at bay the struggling, feeble truth, if but that lie be fathered
      by a priest and mothered by a throne&mdash;<i>as this one was!</i> 'The
      root of evil' is the spring of joy. Decry it those who will. And those who
      do <i>not</i> love, perchance, may laugh at all its need can mean; but to
      the loving, suffering poor bring no more cant, and cease to voice the
      hollow words of Ignorance and Hypocrisy. It is too cruel, and its deadly
      breath has long enough polluted sympathy and frozen up the springs of
      healthy thought, while sheathing venomed fangs in breaking hearts. Recast
      your heartless creeds! Your theories for the poor are built on these."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back into her chair white and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wild burst of applause. A part of the audience, with that ear
      for sound and that lack of sense to be found in all such gatherings, had
      forgotten that it was not listening to a burst of eloquence which had been
      duly written out and committed to memory for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roland Barker sprang to his feet, held both his hands up, to command
      silence, and said, in a scarcely audible voice, as he trembled from head
      to foot: "Hush, hush! She has told the truth! She has told the awful
      truth! I never saw it all before. Heaven help you to bear it. It seems to
      me I cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Several were pale and weeping. I turned to speak to the woman who had
      changed an evening's entertainment into a tragic scene; but she had
      slipped out during the excitement. I took Barker's arm and we walked
      towards the Avenue together. Neither of us spoke until we reached Madison
      Square. Here the poor fellow sank into a seat and pulled me down beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk to me about theories after that," he said. "Great God! I am
      more dead than alive. I feel fifty years older than when I went to that
      little hall to teach those people how to live by my fine philosophy, and I
      truly thought that I had tasted sorrow and found the key to resignation.
      Ye gods!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you have," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," he replied, impatiently; "but suppose I had to face life day
      by day, hour by hour, as that woman pictured it&mdash;and she was a lady
      with as keen a sense of pain as I&mdash;what do you suppose my philosophy
      would do for me then? Do you think I could endure it? And I went there to
      teach those people how to suffer and be strong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Barker," I said, "you'd better go home now and go to bed. You
      are cold and tired, and this won't help matters any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply. When we reached his door he asked again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head and left him standing in the brilliant hall of his
      beautiful home, dazed and puzzled and alone.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next time I met Roland Barker he grasped my hand and said excitedly:
      "I have found that woman! What she said is all true. My God! what is to be
      done? I feel like a strong man tied hand and foot, while devilish vultures
      feed on the flesh of living babes before my eyes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Barker," I said; "stop, and go away for a while, or you will go
      mad. What have you been doing? Look at your hands; they tremble like the
      hands of a palsied man; and your face; why, Barker, your face is haggard
      and set, and your hair is actually turning gray! What in the name of all
      that's holy have you been doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, absolutely nothing!" he exclaimed "That is the trouble! What <i>can</i>
      I do? I tell you something is wrong, Gordon, something is desperately
      wrong in this world. Look at that pile of stone over there: millions of
      dollars are built into that. It is opened once each week, aired, cleaned,
      and put in order for a fashionable audience dressed in silk and
      broadcloth. They call it a church, but it is simply a popular club house,
      which, unlike other club houses, hasn't the grace to pay its own taxes.
      They use that club house, let us say, three hours in all, each week, for
      what? To listen to elaborate music and fine-spun theories about another
      world. They are asked to, and they give money to send these same theories
      to nations far away, who&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;are quite as well
      off without them. Then that house is closed for a week, and those who sat
      there really believe that they have done what is right by their
      fellow-men! Their natural consciences, their sense of right and justice,
      have been given an anaesthetic. 'The poor ye have with you always,' they
      are taught to believe, is not only true, but <i>right</i>. I tell you,
      Gordon, it is all perfectly damnable, and it seems to me that I cannot
      bear it when I remember that woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is only one of a great many," I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Barker groaned: "My God! that is the trouble&mdash;so many that the
      thing seems hopeless. And to think that on every one of even these poor
      souls is laid another burden that that stone spire may go untaxed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barker," I said, laying my hand on his arm, "tell me what has forced all
      this upon you with such a terrible weight just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here, not now," he said. "I have written it down just as she told it
      to me&mdash;you know I learned stenography when I began taking an interest
      in public meetings. Well, I've just been copying those notes out. They are
      in my pocket," he said, laying his hand on his breast. "They seem to burn
      my very soul. I would not dare to trust myself to read them to you here.
      Come home with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were seated in his magnificent library, he glanced about him, and
      with a wave of his hand said, with infinite satire: "You will notice the
      striking appropriateness of the surroundings and the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," I said. "I have often noticed that before, especially the last
      time I heard a sermon preached to three of the Vanderbilts, two Astors,
      five other millionaires, and about sixty more consistent Christians, all
      of whom were wealthy. The subject was Christ's advice to the rich young
      man, 'Sell all thou hast and give to the poor.' But never mind; go on; the
      day has passed when deed and creed are supposed to hold the slightest
      relation to each other; and what is a $20,000 salary for if not to buy
      sufficient ability to explain it all sweetly away and administer, at the
      same time, an ansthetic to the natural consciences of men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I settled myself in a large Turkish chair on one side of the splendidly
      carved table; he stood on the other side sorting a manuscript. Presently
      he began reading it. "'When I married Frank Melville he was strong and
      grand and brave; a truer man never lived. He had been educated for the
      law. His practice was small, but we were able to live very well on what he
      made, and the prospect for the future was bright. We loved each other&mdash;but,
      ah! there are no words to tell that. We worshipped each other as only two
      who have been happily mated can ever understand. We lived up to his
      salary. Perhaps you will say that that was not wise. We thought it was. A
      good appearance, a fairly good appearance at least, was all that we could
      make, and to hold his own in his profession, this was necessary. You know
      how that is. A shabby-looking man soon loses his hold on paying clients.
      Of course he would not dress well and allow me to be ill-clad. He&mdash;he
      loved me. We were never able to lay by anything; but we were young and
      strong and hopeful&mdash;and we loved each other.'" Barker's voice
      trembled. He looked at me a moment and then said very low: "If you could
      have seen her poor, tired, beautiful eyes when she said that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can imagine how she looked," I said. "She had a face one remembers."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little he went on: "We had both been brought up to live well. Our
      friends were people of culture, and we&mdash;it will sound strange to you
      for me to say that our love and devotion were the admiration and talk of
      all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'By-and-by I was taken ill. My husband could not bear to think of me as
      at home alone, suffering He stayed with me a great deal. I did not know
      that he was neglecting his business; I think he did not realize it then;
      he thought he could make it all up; he was strong and&mdash;he loved me.
      At last the doctors told him that I should die if he did not take me away;
      I ought to have an ocean voyage. It almost killed him that he could not
      give me that. We had not the money. He took me away a little while where I
      could breathe the salt air, and the good it did me made his heart only the
      sadder when he saw that it was true that all I needed was an ocean voyage.
      The climate of his home was slowly killing me. We bore it as long as we
      dared, and I got so weak that he almost went mad. Then we moved here,
      where my health was good. But it was a terrible task to get business;
      there were so many others like him, all fighting, as if for life, for
      money enough to live on from day to day. The strain was too much for him,
      and just as he began to gain a footing he fell ill, and&mdash;and if we
      had had money enough for him to take a rest then, and have proper care,
      good doctors, and be relieved from immediate anxiety, he would have gotten
      well, with my care&mdash;I loved him so! But as it was&mdash;' Shall I
      show you the end?" Barker stopped, he was trembling violently, his eyes
      were full of tears. I waited. Presently he said, huskily: "Shall I tell
      you, Gordon, what I saw? I have not gotten over it yet. She laid her
      finger on her lips and motioned me to follow. The room where we had been
      was poor and bare. She took a key from her bosom, opened a door, and went
      in. I followed. Sitting in the only comfortable chair&mdash;which had been
      handsome once&mdash;was a magnificent-looking man, so far as mere physical
      proportions can make one that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Darling,' she said tenderly, as if talking to a little child. 'Darling,
      I have brought you a present. Are you glad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She handed him a withered rose that I had carelessly dropped as I went
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He arose, bowed to me when she presented me, waved me to his chair, took
      the flower, looked at her with infinite love, and said: 'To-morrow, little
      wife; wait till to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he sat down, evidently unconscious of my presence, and gazed
      steadily at her for a moment, seeming to forget all else and to struggle
      with some thought that constantly eluded him. She patted his hand as if he
      were a child, smiling through her heart-break all the while, kissed him,
      and motioned me to precede her from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When she came out she locked the door carefully behind her, sank into a
      chair, covered her face with her hands, and sobbed as if her heart would
      break. After a while she said: 'A little money would have saved, him and
      now it is too late, too late. Sometimes he is violent, sometimes like
      that. The doctors say the end is not far off, and that any moment he may
      kill me, and afterwards awake to know it! It is all the result of poverty
      <i>with love!'</i> she said. Then, passionately: 'If I did not love him so
      I could bear it, but <i>I cannot, I cannot!</i> And how will <i>he</i>
      bear it if he ever harms me&mdash;and I not there to help him?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barker stepped to the window to hide his emotion. Presently he said, in a
      voice that trembled: "If she did not love him so she could let him go to
      some&mdash;asylum; but she knows the end is sure, and not far off, and
      that the gleams of light he has are when he sees her face. She has parted
      with everything that made life attractive to keep food and warmth for him.
      She is simply existing now from day to day&mdash;one constant agony of
      soul and sense&mdash;waiting for the end. She allowed me to take a doctor
      to see him; I would have come for you, but you were out of town. He only
      confirmed what others had told her a year ago. He advised her to have him
      put in a safe place before he did some violence; but she refused, and made
      us promise not to interfere. She said he would be able to harm no one but
      her, if he became violent at the last, and she was ready for that. It was
      easier far to live that way and wait for that each day than to have him
      taken away where he would be unhappy and perhaps ill-treated. He needed
      her care and love beside him every hour, and she &mdash;she needed
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Barker flung himself into a chair and let his head fall on his folded
      arms on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the way love makes poverty easy to bear," he said, bitterly,
      after a time, and his trembling hands clinched tight together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you give her any money?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned. "Yes, yes, I&mdash;that is, I left some on the table under her
      sewing. She isn't the kind of woman one can offer charity. She&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I said, "she isn't, and beside, for the pain that tortures her it is
      too late now for money to help. Only it may relieve her somewhat to feel
      sure that she can get what he needs to eat and wear and to keep him warm
      and allow her to be free from the necessity of outside work. I am glad you
      left the money. But&mdash;but&mdash;Barker, do you think she will use it,
      coming that way and from a stranger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up forlornly. "No, I don't," he said; "and yet she may. I will
      hope so; but if she does, what then? The terrible question will still
      remain just where it was. That is no way to solve it; we can't bail out
      the ocean with a thimble. And what an infamous imposition all this talk is
      of 'resignation' to such as she; for her terrible calm, as she talked to
      me, had no hint of resignation in it. She is simply, calmly, quietly
      desperate now&mdash;and she is one of many." He groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take me there the next time you go?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said I must not come back; she could not be an object of curiosity&mdash;nor
      allow him to be. She said that she allowed me to come this time because on
      the night we first saw her she had stepped into that little hall to keep
      herself from freezing in her thin clothes as she was making her way home,
      and she saw that I was earnest in what I said, and she stayed to listen&mdash;"
      his voice broke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the drapery was drawn back, and his wife, superbly robed, swept
      in, bringing a bevy of girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Barker," said one, gayly, "you don't know what you missed
      to-night by deserting our theatre party; it was all so real&mdash;love in
      rags, you know, and all that sort of thing; only I really don't like to
      see <i>quite</i> so much attention paid to the 'Suffering poor,' with a
      big S, and the lower classes generally. I think the stage can do far
      better than that, don't you? But it is the new fad, I suppose, and after
      all I fancy it doesn't do much harm, only as it makes that sort of people
      more insufferably obtrusive about putting their ill-clad, bad-smelling
      woes before the rest of us. What a beautiful vase this is, Mrs. Barker!
      May I take it to the light?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my dear," laughed Mrs. Barker; "and I agree with you, as
      usual. I think it is an exquisite vase&mdash;and that the stage is
      becoming demoralized. It is pandering to the low taste for representations
      of low life. I confess I don't like it. That sort of people do not have
      the feelings to be hurt&mdash;the fine sensibilities and emotions
      attributed to them. Those grow up in refined and delicate surroundings.
      That is what I often tell Roland when he insists upon making himself
      unhappy over some new 'case' of destitution. I tell him to send them five
      dollars by mail and not to worry himself, and I won't allow him to worry
      me with his Christie-street emotions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barker winced, and I excused myself and withdrew, speculating on certain
      phases of delicacy of feeling and fine sensibility.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I did not see Barker again for nearly three weeks, when one night my bell
      was rung with unusual violence, and I heard an excited voice in my hall.
      "Be quick, John; hurry," it said, "and tell the doctor I must see him at
      once. Tell him it is Roland Barker."
    </p>
    <p>
      John had evidently demurred at calling me at so late an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Barker; I'll be down in a moment," I called from above. "No,
      come up. You can tell me what is the matter while I dress. Is it for
      yourself? There, go in that side room, I can hear you, and I'll be dressed
      in a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurry, hurry," he said, excitedly, "I'll tell you on the way. I have my
      carriage. Don't wait to order yours, only hurry, hurry, hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the carriage, I said: "Barker, you are going to use yourself up,
      this way. You can't keep this sort of thing up much longer. You'd better
      go abroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drive faster," he called, to the man on top. Then to me, "If you are not
      the first doctor there? there will be a dreadful scene. They will most
      likely arrest her for murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom?" said I. "You have told me nothing, and how can I prevent that if a
      murder has been committed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By giving her a regular death certificate," said he, coolly, "saying that
      you attended the case, and that it was a natural death. I depend upon you,
      Gordon; it would be simply infamous to make her suffer any more. I cannot
      help her now, but you can, you <i>must</i>. No one will know the truth but
      us, and afterwards we can help her&mdash;to forget. She is not an old
      woman; there may be something in life for her yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it the Lady of the Club?" I asked. We had always called her that "What
      has she done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "it is the 'Lady of the Club.' and she has poisoned her
      husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" exclaimed I; "and you want me to give her a regular death
      certificate and say I attended the case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must," he said; "it would be infamous not to. She could not bear it
      any longer. She found herself breaking down, and she would not leave him
      alive without her care and love. He had become almost helpless, except
      when short violent spells came on. These left him exhausted. He almost
      killed her in the last one. Her terror was that he would do so and then
      regain his reason&mdash;that he would know it afterwards and perhaps be
      dragged through the courts. She had been working in a chemist's office, it
      seems, when she was able to do anything. She took some aconitine, and
      to-night she put everything in perfect order, gave him the best supper she
      could, got him to bed, and then&mdash;gave him that. She sent for me and
      told me as calmly as&mdash;God! it was the calm of absolute desperation.
      She sat there when I went in, holding his poor dead hand and kissing it
      reverently. She laid it down and told me what I tell you. There was not a
      tear, a moan, a sigh. She said: 'Here is the money you left&mdash;all
      except what I paid for his supper to-night. We had gotten down to that
      before I had the chance to steal the poison or the courage to give it to
      him. I had not meant to use any of the money; the rest is here. I would
      like it used&mdash;if you are willing&mdash;to bury him decently, not in
      the Potter's Field, and I would like&mdash;if you will take the trouble&mdash;to
      have it done absolutely privately. We have borne enough. I cannot bear for
      even his ashes to be subjected to any further humiliation.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland Barker paused to command himself. "Of course I promised her," he
      went on, after a time. "She does not realize that she may be arrested and
      have his poor body desecrated to find the cause of death. That would make
      her insane&mdash;even if&mdash; Drive faster!" he called out again to the
      man outside. When we reached the house he said: "Be prepared to see her
      perfectly calm. It is frightful to witness, and I tremble for the result
      later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we knocked on her door there was no response. I pushed it open and
      entered first. The room was empty. We went to the inner doer and rapped
      gently, then louder. There was no sound. Barker opened the door, and then
      stepped quickly back and closed it. "She is kneeling there by his bed," he
      said; "write the certificate here and give it to me. Then I will bring an
      undertaker and&mdash;he and I can attend to everything else. I did want
      you to see her. I think you should give her something to make her sleep.
      That forced calm will make her lose her mind. She is so shattered you
      would not recognize her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay here, Barker," I said; "I want to see her alone for a moment. I will
      tell her who I am and that you brought me&mdash;if I need to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyed me sharply, but I stepped hastily into the inner room. I touched
      the shoulder and then the forehead of the kneeling form. It did not move.
      "Just as I expected," I muttered, and lifting the lifeless body in my arms
      I laid it gently beside her husband. In one hand she held the vial from
      which she had taken the last drop of the deadly drug, and clasped in the
      other her husband's fingers. She had been dead but a few moments, and both
      she and her husband were robed for the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the outer room I found Barker with a note in his hand,
      and a shocked and horrified look on his face. He glanced up at me through
      his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were too late," he said. "She left this note for me. I found it here
      on the table. She meant to do it all along, and that is why she was so
      calm and had no fears for herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so when you told me what she had done," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you? I did not for a moment, or I would have stayed and tried to
      reason her out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is best as it is," said I, "and you could not have reasoned her out of
      it. It was inevitable&mdash;after the rest. Take this certificate too; you
      will need both."
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was safely over, as we drove home from the new graves two days
      later, Barker said: "Is this the solution?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said: "To the dead, who cannot suffer, we can be kind and
      shield them even from themselves. Is there no way to help the living? A
      few hundred dollars, two short years ago, would have saved all this, and
      there was no way for her to get it. She knew it <i>all</i> then, and there
      was no help!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did she not, in such a case as that, push back her pride and go to
      some one? There must be thousands who would have gladly responded to such
      a call as that," I argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He buried his face in his hands for a moment and shuddered. At last he
      said: "She did&mdash;she went to three good men, men who had known, been
      friendly with, admired her and her husband. Two of them are worth their
      millions, the other one is rich. She only asked to borrow, and promised to
      repay it herself if she had to live and work after he were dead to do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not mean to tell me that they refused&mdash;and they old friends
      and rich?" I asked, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean to say just this: they one and all made some excuse; they did not
      let her have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She told them what the doctors said, and of her fears?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did," he answered, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you say they are good men!" I exclaimed, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, benevolent, charitable, every one of them," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you one of them, Barker?" I asked, after a moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God, no!" he replied. "But perhaps in some other case I have done
      the same, if I only knew the whole story. Those men do not know this last,
      you must remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the worst of it is, we dare not tell them," said I, as we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we dare not," he replied, and left me standing with the copy of the
      burial certificate in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Natural causes?" I said to myself, looking at it. "Died of natural causes&mdash;the
      brutality and selfishness of man&mdash;and poverty with love. <i>Natural</i>
      causes! Yes." And I closed my office door and turned out the light.

      When the new family moved into, and we were told had bought, the cottage
      nearest our own, we were naturally interested in finding out what kind of
      people they were, and whether we had gained or lost by the change of
      neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a summer place like this it makes a good deal of difference just what
      kind of people live so near to you that when you are sitting on your
      veranda and they are swinging in hammocks on theirs, the most of the
      conversation is common property, unless you whisper, and one does not want
      to spend three or four months of each year mentally and verbally tiptoeing
      about one's own premises. Then, on the other hand, there are few less
      agreeable situations to be placed in than to be forced to listen to
      confidences or quarrels with which you have nothing whatever to do, or
      else be deprived of the comforts and pleasures of out-door life, to secure
      which you endure so many other annoyances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our new neighbors were, therefore, as you will admit, of the utmost
      interest and importance to us, and I was naturally very much pleased, at
      the end of the first week, when I returned one day from a fishing party,
      from which my wife's headache had detained her, by the report she gave me
      of their attitude toward each other. (From her glowing estimate, I drew
      rose-colored pictures of their probable kindliness and generosity toward
      others.) Up to this time they had been but seldom outside of their house,
      and we had not gathered much information of their doings, except the fact
      that a good deal of nice furniture had come, and they appeared to be
      greatly taken up in beautifying and arranging their cottage. This much
      promised well, so far as it went; but we had not lived to our time of life
      not to find out, long ago, that the most exquisitely appointed houses
      sometimes lack the one essential feature; that is, ladies and gentlemen to
      occupy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are lovely!" said my wife, the moment I entered the door, before I
      had been able to deposit my fishing-tackle and ask after her headache.
      "They are lovely; at least he is," she amended. "I am sure we shall be
      pleased with them; or, at least, with him. A man as careful of, and
      attentive to, his wife as he is can't help being an agreeable neighbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said I. "How did you find out? And how is your headache?&mdash;Had
      a disgusting time fishing. Glad you did not go. Sun was hot; breeze was
      hot; boatman's temper was a hundred and twenty in the shade; bait wouldn't
      stay on the hooks, and there weren't any fish any way. But how did you say
      your head is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head?" said my wife, with that retrospective tone women have, which
      seemed to indicate that if she had ever had a head, and if her head had
      ever ached, and if headache was a matter of sufficient importance to
      remember, in all human probability it had recovered in due time. "My head?
      Oh, yes&mdash;Oh, it is all right; but you really never did see any one so
      tractable as that man. And adaptable! Why, it is a perfect wonder. Of
      course I had no business to look or listen; but I did. I just couldn't
      help it. The fact is, I thought they were quarrelling at first, and I
      almost fainted. I said to myself, 'If they are that kind of people we will
      sell out. I will not live under the constant drippings of ill-temper.'
      Quarrelling ought to be a penitentiary offence; that is, I mean the
      bickerings and naggings most people dignify by that name. I could endure a
      good, square, stand-up and knock down quarrel, that had some character to
      it; but the eternal differences, often expressed by the tones of voice
      only, I can't stand." I smiled an emphatic assent, and my wife went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must confess his tones of voice are, at times, against him; but
      I'm not sure that it is not due to the distance. <i>All</i> of his tones
      may not carry this far. I'm sure they don't, for when I first heard him,
      and made up my mind that it was a horrid, common, plebeian little row, I
      went to the west bedroom window&mdash;you know it looks directly into
      their kitchen&mdash;and what do you suppose I saw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was so sudden and wholly unexpected, and my mental apparatus
      was so taken up with the story that I found myself with no ideas whatever
      on the subject Indeed I do not believe that my wife wanted me to guess
      what she saw, half so much as she wanted breath; but I gave the only reply
      which the circumstances appeared to admit of, and which, I was pleased to
      see, in spite of its seeming inadequacy, was as perfectly satisfactory to
      the blessed little woman as if it had been made to order and proven a
      perfect fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't imagine," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can't," she replied, pushing my crossed legs into position,
      and seating herself on my knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can't. A man couldn't. Well, it seems their servant left
      last night, and that blessed man was washing the dishes this morning. The
      difference of opinion had been over which one of them should do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the confounded brute!" said I. "He is a good deal better able to do
      it than she is. She looks sick, and so long as he has no business to
      attend to down here, he has as much time as she and a good deal more
      strength to do that kind of work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I just knew you'd look at it that way," said my wife, with an
      inflection of pride and admiration which indicated that I had made a ten
      strike of some kind, of which few men&mdash;and not many women&mdash;would
      be capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that was not it at all," continued she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began laboriously to readjust my mental moorings to this seemingly
      complicated situation, and was on the verge of wondering why my wife was
      so pleased with me for simply making a mistake, when she began again,
      after giving me a little pat of unqualified satisfaction and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They both wanted to do it. She said she wasn't a bit tired and could do
      it alone just as well as not, and he'd break the glasses with his funny,
      great, big fingers; and he said he'd be careful not to break anything, and
      that the dish-water would spoil her hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said I, "I shall like the fellow. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you will," my wife broke in, enthusiastically; "but that isn't
      all. I went to sleep after that, and later on was awakened by a loud&mdash;and
      as I thought at the time&mdash;a very angry voice. I went to the window
      again only to see a laughing scuffle between them over the potato-knife.
      She wanted to scrape them and he wanted to scrape them. Of course he got
      the knife, and it really did look too comical to see him work with those
      little bulbs. He put his whole mind on them, and he didn't catch her
      picking over the berries until she was nearly done. Then he scolded again.
      He said he did the potatoes to keep her from getting her thumb and
      forefinger black, and here she was with her whole hand covered with berry
      stain. He seemed really vexed, and I must say his voice doesn't carry this
      far as if he was half as nice as he is. I think there ought to be a chair
      of voices attached to every school-house&mdash;so to speak&mdash;and the
      result of the training made one of the tests of admission to the colleges
      of the country. Don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I was wholly unprepared for her sudden question, and was only slowly
      clambering around the idea she had suggested, so I said&mdash;somewhat
      irrelevantly, no doubt&mdash;"It may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me for a moment without speaking, and then said, as she got
      up and crossed the room: "You didn't hear a word I said, and you don't
      begin to appreciate that man anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did hear you, dear," I protested; "I was listening as hard as I could&mdash;and
      awfully interested&mdash;but a fellow can't skip along at that rate and
      have well-matured views on tap without a moment's warning. You've got to
      be like the noble ladies in the 'Lay of the Last Minstrel,' 'and give me
      heart and give me time.' Now <i>they</i> understood men. We're slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and tied the last pink bow in the lace of a coquettish little
      white gown and dragged me out on the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our new neighbors were out ahead of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so at all, Margaret," we heard him say, as we took our
      chairs near the edge of the porch to catch any stray breeze that might be
      wandering our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;," we heard her say; "don't talk so loud. They will think you
      are going to scalp me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't bother about the neighbors; let 'em hear," said he, "let 'em
      think. Who cares? If they haven't got anything better to do than sit
      around and think, they'd better move away from our neighborhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;said she again, looking at him with a good deal of emphasis in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is too bad, isn't it?" acquiesced he, in a much lower voice, and
      one from which every vestige of the tone of protest had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>is</i> too bad that these summer cottages are built so close
      together that you can't tie your shoes without being overheard by the
      folks next door? It makes me nervous. I feel as if I had to sit up
      straight all the time and smile like a crocodile, or else run the risk of
      being misunderstood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>is</i> trying, dear," she said, "and destroys a good deal of the
      comfort and ease of one's outing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind," began he, so explosively as to make my wife jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;," whispered the lady next door, but he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind. I don't let it bother me in the least. They can
      attend to their own affairs, and I&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;," said his wife; "suppose we walk down to the beach." She began
      to adjust her wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a good deal more comfortable here," he protested, "and besides I'm
      tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are, of course," she said, regretfully. "I forgot. Such unusual
      work for a man would tire him;" and she loosened the lace veil she had
      drawn over her head and reseated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, are you ready?" questioned he, clapping on his hat and suddenly
      starting down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready for what?" asked she, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce, Margaret. I thought you said that you were going to the
      beach!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up, readjusted her veil, took her wrap on her arm, and ran lightly
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if I shall need this wrap?" she said as she passed our gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens! no," he replied, "and it will heat you all up to carry it. Here,
      give it to me. I don't see what on earth you brought it for. I'm certainly
      hot enough without loading me up with this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will carry it," she said, cheerfully; "I don't feel the heat on my arm
      as you do&mdash;or I'll run back and leave it on the porch. You walk
      slowly. I can easily catch up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She started; but he took the shawl from her, threw it lightly over his
      shoulder, and, pulling her hand through his arm, said gayly, and in the
      most compliant tone: "It isn't very warm. I won't notice this little thing
      and, besides, you'll need it down there, as like as not."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were out of hearing my wife drew a long breath and said: "I
      wonder if we ever sound like that to other people?&mdash;and yet, they
      seem to be devoted to each other," she added hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are, no doubt," said I, "only he appears to be a chronic kicker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A comic what?" said my wife, in so loud a tone that I involuntarily
      exclaimed "Sh&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We both laughed. Then she said: "But really, dear, I didn't understand
      what you said he was. There doesn't seem to me to be anything comic about
      him, though. And&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comic! Well, I should think not," said I. "I should think it would be
      anything but comic to that little woman to go through that sort of thing
      every time she opened her mouth. What I said was that he seems to be a
      chronic kicker, and I might add&mdash;with some show of fairness&mdash;that
      he impresses me as the champion of Kicktown at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;," laughed my wife, "they're coming back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree with you at all. There is no need to do anything of the
      kind," were the first words we heard from a somewhat distant couple, and
      my wife concluded that our new neighbors were not very far off. "It would
      be no end of trouble for you. You'd get all tired out; and besides, what
      do we owe to the Joneses that makes it necessary for you to disturb all
      our little comforts to ask them down here?" he continued. We could not
      hear her reply; but his protest and evident deep dissatisfaction with the
      whole scheme went bravely on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed into the house and left him on the steps. When she came out a
      few moments later he said, sweetly: "As I was just saying, it will be
      quite a diversion for you to see the girls, and I'd enjoy the old man
      hugely. He's a jolly old coon; and then we owe it to them after all they
      did for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What girls? What old man is a jolly coon?" asked she, in an utterly
      bewildered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Margaret! The Joneses, of course. Whom have we been talking about for the
      last half-hour?" exploded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said she, having evidently quite given over asking the Joneses, and
      become occupied with other thoughts, "I thought the idea did not please
      you. But I'm so glad. It will do you good to have him here, and I shall be
      delighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me good!" exploded he. "Do me good! Tiresome old bore, if there ever
      was one. Women are queer fish to deal with, but I'm sure I don't care whom
      you invite here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our neighbors withdrew for the night and we sighed with relief. About two
      o'clock my wife touched me to find if I was asleep. The movement was so
      stealthy that I inferred at once that there were burglars in the house. I
      was wide awake in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm glad you're awake. I want to know what that was you called the
      man next door. I forgot what it was, and I couldn't sleep for trying to
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. "I believe I said that he impressed me as one so addicted to
      the reprehensible habit of protest&mdash;on general principles, as it were&mdash;that
      it had now become the normal condition of his mental constitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't say any such thing," said she. "You&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe that at the time of which you speak I allowed myself to be
      guilty of a habit you do not wholly admire; but I really had no idea it
      would keep you awake. I used slang. I said that he was a chronic kicker,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it! That's it!" exclaimed she, with deep satisfaction. "He's a
      'chronic kicker.' Well, if you'll believe me, he hasn't stopped kicking
      long enough to say his prayers decently since we went to bed. First about
      what time it was; then about which room they'd sleep in; then there was
      too much cover; then the windows were wrong; then&mdash;oh, heavens!&mdash;I
      wonder if he kicks in his sleep? He always comes around to reason in time;
      but if there was ever anything more maddening to meet than that constant
      wall of protest&mdash;for the sake of protest&mdash;I don't know what it
      could be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor&mdash;I," said I, half asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her hand grasped mine vigorously, and I sprang up startled, for
      I had been sound asleep again. "What's the matter?" I said, in a loud
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh&mdash;," whispered my wife. "Don't speak in that tone. I'd rather
      people would think you stayed out nights, than to suppose you stayed at
      home and nagged me. He's at it again. I'd most gone to sleep and his voice
      nearly scared the life out of me. She wanted to close the window. He
      objected, of course; said he'd smother&mdash;sh&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then we heard our neighbor's wife ask sleepily: "What are you doing,
      dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Closing this detestable window. Lets in too much salt air. 'Fraid you'll
      get chilled. I am. Where's another blanket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The window went down with a bang, and we heard no more of our neighbors
      that night. But the next morning the same thing began again, and I do not
      believe that during that entire summer he ever agreed with his wife the
      first time she spoke, nor failed to come around to her view after he took
      time to think it over. I remember when I was introduced to him, a week
      later, his wife said: "This is our nearest neighbor, you know, Thomas, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he isn't, Margaret; the people back of us are nearer," he said. Then
      to me: "Pleased to meet you. I believe our wives have become quite good
      friends. I'm very glad for Margaret's sake, too. It's dull for her with
      only an old fellow like me to entertain her, and she not very well. And
      then, as she says, you are our nearest neighbor, and we really ought not
      to be too ceremonious at such a place as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, Thomas," suggested his wife, "that you said one could not be
      too particular. Why, you quite blustered when I first told you I had made
      advances to some of the other&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! I did nothing of the kind," broke in he. "What on earth ever
      put such an idea into your head, Margaret? You know I always say that
      without pleasant neighbors, and friendly relations with them, a summer
      cottage is no place for a white man to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife hastened to change the subject. Nothing on earth is more
      distasteful to her than a family contest, of even a very mild type,
      especially when the tones of voice seem to express more of indignation and
      a desire to override, than a mere difference of opinion. She thought the
      surf a safe subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was not the water lovely to-day? You were in, I suppose?" she inquired of
      our neighbor's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we were in," she began, enthusiastically. "It was perfect and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you call perfect," broke in he, "I called it beastly.
      It was so cold I felt like a frog when I got out, and you looked half
      frozen. The fact is, this is too far north to bathe for pleasure in the
      surf. It may be good for one's health, but it is anything but pleasant.
      Now at Old Point Comfort it is different. I like it there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, James," said his wife, "I thought you preferred this because of the
      more bracing and exhilarating effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little more objection, which he seemed to think firmly established
      his independence, he ended his remarks thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, as you say, it is more bracing. Yes, that's a fact, Margaret.
      I couldn't help noticing when I came out this morning that I felt like a
      new man, and you&mdash;why, 'pon my word, you looked as bright and rosy as
      a girl of sixteen. Oh, the surf here is great. It really is. I like it;
      don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This last he had addressed to me. I was so occupied in a study of, and so
      astonished by, the facility with which he took his mental flops, after
      enjoying his little "kick," that I was taken off my feet by his sudden
      appeal to me, and was quite at a loss for a reply which would do justice
      to the occasion, and at the same time put a stop to the contest between
      husband and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as usual, my wife hastened to my rescue and covered my confusion by
      her gay little laugh and explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha, ha," she laughed, "you have caught my husband napping already. I
      know exactly where he was. He was lumbering along through an elaborate
      speculation on, and a comparison of, the relative merits of&mdash;" here
      she began telling them off on her fingers to the great amusement of our
      neighbors&mdash;"first, fresh and salt water bathing; second, the method,
      time, place, and condition of each as affected by the moon, stars, and
      Gulf Stream. He was, most likely, climbing over Norway with a thermometer,
      or poking a test-tube of some kind into the semi-liquefaction which passes
      itself off as water to those unfortunates who are stranded along the
      shores of the Mississippi. Just wait; one of these days he will get down
      to our discussion and he'll agree with us when he gets there. But don't
      hurry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      We all joined in the laugh at my expense; and I remarked that I had served
      so long as a target for my wife's fun that even if I could skip around,
      mentally, at as lively a rate as she seemed to expect, I would pretend
      that I couldn't, in order not to deprive her of her chief source of
      amusement. At this point our neighbor's new cook came to the edge of their
      porch and asked her mistress if she might speak to her for a moment. She
      arose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thunder, Margaret, I hope you don't intend to allow that worthless
      girl to call you home every time you go any place. Tell her to wait. It
      can't be much she wants," said our neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," said his wife sweetly, reseating herself, "you can wait until I
      come home. It won't be long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if you'd better do that, Margaret," said he, just as our wives
      had begun to discuss something relative to housekeeping. "Jane is a good
      girl, and she wouldn't call you if it were not something important, Don't
      you think we had better go at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did think so," said she, and bidding us goodnight our neighbors crossed
      the lawn and re-entered their own door and closed it for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long pause my wife said, in a stage whisper: "I suppose it is his
      way of showing that he is 'boss,' as the boys say&mdash;the final appeal
      in his own household&mdash;his idea of the dignity of the masculine
      prerogative."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden stop. I thought she expected me to say something, so I began:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I doubt it. It looks to me like a case of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! don't!" exclaimed my wife, in tragic accents "oh, <i>don't</i>
      catch it. I really couldn't live with a chronic objector. Anything else. I
      really believe I could stand any other phase of bullying better than that&mdash;to
      feel that at any minute I am liable to run against a solid wall of 'I
      don't agree with you!' If it were <i>real</i> I wouldn't mind it so much;
      but to hear that man 'kick,' as you say, just for the sake of asserting
      himself, and then come around as he does, is perfectly maddening. The very
      first symptom I see in you I shall look upon it as a danger signal&mdash;I'll
      move."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, before our quiet little laugh, at their expense, had died
      away, there floated out from the bedroom window of our neighbors' cottage,
      this refrain:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, goodness knows, Margaret, <i>I</i> didn't want to come home. I knew
      it was all perfect nonsense. If you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife suddenly arose, took me by the hand and said quite seriously:
      "Come in the house, dear. This atmosphere is too unwholesome to endure any
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she said to me, "Let's go to Old Point Comfort next year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said I; "but what shall we do with the cottage? You know we
      hold the lease for another year, with the 'refusal' to buy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rent it to your worst enemy, or, better still, get him to buy it. Just
      think of the exquisite revenge you could take that way. Twenty-four hours
      every day, for four long months each year, to know that you had him
      planted next door to a 'chronic kicker.' Or don't you hate anybody bad
      enough for that?" and my wife actually shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe I do, dear," said I; "but I'll do my level best to <i>rent</i>
      it to him for one season. You know I wouldn't care to murder him; if he's
      hopelessly maimed I'll be satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      We both laughed; but the next day I advertised the lease of a cottage for
      sale very cheap, and gave as a reason my desire to go where there were
      fewer people. I think this will catch my enemy. He likes a crowd, and he'd
      enjoy nothing better than to feel that I was forced to pay half of his
      rent. So I marked the paper and sent it to him, and confidently await the
      result.

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after Fred Mathews began the practice of law he was elected to the
      office of Prosecuting Attorney in the Western town to which he had gone
      when first admitted to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, every law student becomes familiar with the jests and gibes
      cast at the members of the profession as men who are peculiarly economical
      of the truth. He smiles with those who hint that a lawyer is always lavish
      of advice that leads to litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That students of Blackstone and Coke hear much merrymaking over and some
      serious criticism of the quibbles to which the best of them are supposed
      to resort&mdash;of making little of real evidence and much of trivialities&mdash;goes
      without saying. Nor are they unaware of the fact&mdash;alas! sometimes too
      well founded upon strong evidence&mdash;that the general public appears to
      be convinced that laws are made for the purpose of shielding the rich and
      oppressing the poor or unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      No student of average ability enters practice uninformed that there is a
      widespread belief that a man of social position or financial power has
      little to fear as a result of his misdeeds, while his less fortunate
      neighbor could not hope to escape the worst legal consequences of his most
      trivial lapse from rectitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred Mathews had made up his mind&mdash;as many a young fellow had done
      before him&mdash;that he would do everything in his power to hold the
      scales of justice level.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined that such ability as he possessed should be used for the
      benefit of society, and that neither bribe nor threat should ever entice
      him from the strict performance of his duty to the profession which he had
      entered. He would never accept a case in which he did not honestly
      believe. No man's money should buy him and no man's wrath intimidate. In
      short, he intended to be a lawyer with a conscience as well as a man of
      integrity, no matter what the result might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made so good a beginning in the first two years of his practice that it
      was at the end of the third, when he found himself holding the office of
      Prosecuting Attorney, with a record clean, and fair sailing ahead, that a
      piece of news which came to him caused him to doubt himself for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of that doubt thrilled every fibre in his nature, for with it
      came the one fear that is terrible to a brave mind which is aroused for
      the first time to its own possibilities&mdash;the fear to trust itself&mdash;the
      dread lest it betray its own higher nature under the pressure of old
      habits of thought or new social problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right and wrong had always seemed to him to have the most decided and
      clear-cut outlines. He had never thought of himself as standing before
      them unable to distinguish their boundaries. He had felt that he could
      answer bravely enough the question: "What would you do if required to
      choose between honor and dishonor?" It was a strange thing to him that his
      present perplexity should grow out of a simple burglary case. There did
      not appear to him, at first, to be more than one side to such a case. He
      was the Prosecuting Attorney. A store had been robbed. Among other things
      a sealskin sacque was taken. By means of this cloak the burglary had been
      traced&mdash;it was claimed&mdash;to a certain young man high in social
      life. The duties of his office had led the State's attorney to prosecute
      the investigation with his usual vigor and impartiality until he had
      succeeded beyond his fairest hopes. Indeed, the chain of evidence now in
      his possession was so strong and complete that he&mdash;for the first time
      in his career&mdash;recognized that he shrank from using the testimony at
      his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that it was his duty to cause to be apprehended a young man who
      had up to the present time borne a spotless reputation; who had been a
      fellow student at college; whose social position was that of a leader, and
      who was soon to marry one of the most charming girls in the town. The
      situation was painful, but Fred Mathews felt that his own honor was at
      stake quite as truly as was that of his old schoolfellow. Here was his
      first opportunity to show that he held his duty above his desires. Here
      was the first case in which social influence and financial power were on
      the side of a criminal whom it was his duty to prosecute to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      His professional pride, as well as his honor, was enlisted; for this was
      the third burglary which had been committed recently, and so far the
      "gang"&mdash;as the newspapers assumed and the police believed the
      offenders to be&mdash;had not been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred Mathews now thought he had every reason to believe that the same hand
      had executed all three crimes and that the recklessness of the last&mdash;the
      almost Wanton defiance of perfectly natural means of precaution and
      concealment&mdash;had led to the discovery of this burglar in high life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long deliberation, however, the young prosecutor made up his mind
      that he would so far compromise with his conscience as to make a personal,
      private call upon the young man who was under suspicion and boldly accuse
      him of the theft of the tell-tale cloak that had been traced to him, and
      take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well aware that in case this course should lead to the escape of
      the criminal he would be compelled to bear the abuse and suspicion which
      would surely follow, for the evidence had passed through other hands than
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he was taking a method which would be called in question, and
      that he would not take it if the suspected man lived in a less fashionable
      street or had the misfortune to be low born.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this he knew quite well, and still he argued to himself that it was
      the right thing for him to do, or at least that it was the best possible
      under the circumstances, and that after giving Walter Banks a private
      chance to clear himself&mdash;if such a thing were possible&mdash;he would
      still be in a position to go on with the case, if that should be
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, for the first time in his career, he allowed himself to be
      kept awake, not by the fear that he should fail through inexperience in
      his duty to his client&mdash;as had happened sometimes to trouble him
      earlier in his professional life&mdash;but by a dread that he should
      wilfully betray his trust to the public. At two o'clock he lay staring at
      the wall, asking himself if he was becoming corrupt; if he, too, believed
      in shielding guilt if only that guilt were dressed in purple and spoke
      with a soft and cultured accent.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Mr. Banks will be down in a moment;" the trim maid had said, and left the
      library door open as she withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prosecutor walked about the room uneasily. He had hoped at the
      last moment that the object of his call would be from home&mdash;that he
      would take fright and refuse to be seen&mdash;that action had been taken
      by the police which would put it out of his power to give the warning that
      he now felt he was here to give. But, no. "Mr. Banks will be down in a
      moment." He had heard quite distinctly, and there had not been the
      slightest accent of fear or annoyance in the voice that spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his agitation he had taken up a curiously wrought paper knife which lay
      upon the table and had dropped it as if it had burned his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" he exclaimed. "<i>He</i> was the college thief. It is no new
      thing, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the knife again and examined it closely. There could be no
      mistake. It was a gold wrought, elaborately engraved blade, set in a
      handle which had no duplicate, for the students, who had planned the gift
      which had so mysteriously disappeared had devised and caused to be
      engraved a secret symbol which was cut deep in the polished surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to have been a surprise for one of the favorites in the faculty. It
      had disappeared&mdash;and here it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mathews. This is really very kind. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of Walter Banks, but their eyes met over the fallen paper
      knife, which had dropped from trembling fingers at the first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great wave of color rushed into the face of young Banks. The prosecutor
      stood mute and pale. Involuntarily he had tried to cover the knife with a
      corner of the rug as he turned to meet his host. It vaguely dawned upon
      him that he was a guest in a house where he was playing the part of a
      detective. His hand was extended in the hearty western fashion which had
      become second nature to him, but Walter Banks did not take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you sit down?" said the host in a tone which was hoarse, and quite
      unlike the frank, free voice that spoke a moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he seated himself he bent forward and took up the bit of tell-tale gold
      and ivory. Then he said, slowly in a tone that was scarcely audible:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I took it. You are right. It <i>is</i> the college knife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! don't!" exclaimed Fred Mathews, rising. "I am&mdash; You forget&mdash;
      I am&mdash; My office. Think. I am for the prosecution!" His face was
      livid. Young Banks leaned heavily against the table. The color began to
      die out of his lips. His hand trembled as he laid the knife upon the
      table. Neither spoke. The brain of the young prosecutor found only scraps
      and shreds of thought, in which such words as duty, honor, pity,
      hospitality, wealth, social order, floated vaguely here and there,
      buffeted by the one insistent idea that he should go&mdash;go quickly&mdash;and
      leave this man alone with his shame and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Banks was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up to my room. Mother might come in here and&mdash;I suppose&mdash;you
      have come about&mdash; I&mdash;Is&mdash;? You say you are for the
      prosecution. Have they traced the cloak to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer stepped back again and looked at the man before him. What could
      he mean by saying such a thing as that&mdash;<i>to him?</i> They had never
      been close friends, but now in spite of everything the thought that he was
      the prosecutor kept itself steadily in the attorney's mind and struggled
      with a pity and reluctance that were seeking to justify him by a belief in
      the insanity of young Banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one but a lunatic would have made that last remark. The thought was a
      relief. He grasped at it eagerly and began to fashion his mental outlook
      to fit the idea. Then suddenly came to him with overwhelming force all he
      had ever heard or read of the failure of justice where criminals of high
      degree were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had followed his host to the stairs. Suddenly he turned, caught up his
      hat from the stand where he had left it, and passed out of the street door
      without a word. Once in the street he glanced involuntarily up at the
      house. At the window of the room he had just left stood Walter Banks. His
      arm was about his mother's shoulders, and both were very pale. There was a
      strange likeness between them.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every conceivable form of pressure to prevent the trial of Walter Banks
      was brought to bear in the next few weeks; but Prosecutor Mathews had
      pushed the case vigorously in spite of it all. He felt not only that
      justice was at stake, but that his own moral fibre was in pawn, as well.
      He held aloof from his social friends&mdash;who were in many cases the
      friends of the accused, also&mdash;lest he lose sight of his duty through
      some fresh or new form of attack upon his integrity of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had come to his knowledge that even the Judge who was to sit in the
      case had been approached by the friends of the defendant, and it was felt
      that it would be difficult to impanel a jury that would or could be fair
      and impartial.
    </p>
    <p>
      If but one man was drawn from the "upper class," the jury would be sure to
      hang. On the other hand, if all of the talesmen were chosen from that
      social caste which feels that it is usually the victim, it would go hard
      with Walter Banks even if he were able&mdash;as seemed wholly unlikely&mdash;to
      show a reasonably clear case in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came. The court-room held an unusual audience. There were many
      ladies present who had never before seen the inside of such a room. They
      held their breath and were filled with awe and fear&mdash;of they knew not
      what.
    </p>

      Perhaps few men can realize what it is to a woman to face for the first
      time the embodiment of all that her strong faith and utter ignorance has
      carried to mature years as an ideal of justice and dignity&mdash;of solemn
      obligation and fearful responsibility. To her there has been no reverse
      side to the picture. She believes in courts as courts of justice. She
      knows nothing of quibble, of technicality, of precedent. Nothing here is
      light or humorous to her. Next to a death chamber the criminal court-room
      is fullest of the thoughts which reach beyond mere human responsibility
      and import, and all that passes there is freighted for her with a sense of
      finality that few men can comprehend. <i>They</i> think of reversal of
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiat of the court is the closing knell to a woman; and although she
      may know the judge in private life to be a fallible or&mdash;more
      incongruous still&mdash;a jovial man, his presence <i>here</i> is
      overpowering. Of the jury she feels vaguely, dread. Of the judge, awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother of the prisoner sat near him. Her sad, pale, refined face
      troubled the young prosecutor sorely and he tugged at his conscience and
      spurred on his resolution after each glance at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was so plain, the evidence so clear, the defence so weak that the
      whole tide of public sentiment swung rapidly from the side of the prisoner
      to that of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignation for him which had been felt by the society women who had
      come to show themselves as his friends changed into scorn and contempt.
      The whole mental atmosphere of the room underwent a revolution. When court
      opened few besides the officers believed him guilty. As the case drew near
      its close no one believed him innocent. He had not been allowed by his
      counsel to take the stand in his own behalf, and this had told strongly
      against him in the minds of both jury and spectators. The prosecuting
      attorney had made a telling speech, and the charge of the judge was
      plainly indicative of his opinion that there was but one verdict to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury had taken but one ballot. They had needed no charge from the
      judge at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guilty,"&mdash;came from the foreman's lips with a decided accent that
      indicated a certain satisfaction in pronouncing it. The prisoner's face
      grew a shade paler, but the puzzled light in his eyes lost nothing of that
      weary, insistent questioning that had marked their depths all day. Indeed,
      he seemed to be as much surprised, as the evidence had been unfolded, as
      were the friends who were there to see him vindicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the speech of the prosecutor and the charge of the judge young
      Banks; mother had held her son's hand and tears had dropped unheeded from
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge had spoken again, but no one moved. The attorney for the
      prisoner bent forward and touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand up for sentence," he said. "The judge"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit still!" It was the woman beside him who spoke. She had dried her
      tears. Every face in the room was turned toward her now. She staggered to
      her feet. Her voice penetrated every corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> am the thief, judge. Sentence me. I stole the cloak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, mother! Great God, it is not true! Mother, sit down! She never
      saw the coat. Mother! Mother! Great God, what does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow had sprung to his feet, but she eluded his grasp, and
      before any one knew what she intended to do she passed onto the witness
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tense silence in the room. No one was prepared for the scene.
      It had been so swiftly done&mdash;so wholly without warning&mdash;that
      every one sat dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had caught up the Bible as she reached the stand and pressed it to her
      lips. She was vaguely aware that this act was looked upon as affecting the
      credibility of the witness. She also imagined that it gave her a right to
      put in her evidence even at this stage of the trial. She supposed that a
      trial was for the purpose of arriving at the facts and that the Court sat
      with that object alone in view. She did not know that it was too late. She
      was unaware that the case would have to be reopened to admit her evidence.
      She did not know that it was possible for the gate of justice to be swung
      shut in the face of truth. She supposed that all trials were for the one
      purpose of getting at the bottom of the case; so that it did not occur to
      her that her action was strange only in so far as such a confession from
      such a woman must be so regarded by all who knew her, and who was there in
      all the town who did not know and respect her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prosecutor sat mute. The eyes of the judge widened in
      astonishment. For the moment he was the man and neighbor only. He forgot
      his office. She was talking rapidly, and all were listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the thief, judge. Let me tell you. It is not right that he should
      suffer for my crime. Poor boy, his life has been a hell on earth for <i>me&mdash;for
      me!</i> And he has never understood. I could not tell him. I shall now. He
      shall understand. <i>You</i> shall, judge. Oh, God, if only a woman sat
      where you do&mdash;a mother! But let me tell you; I can. I thought I could
      not; but I can&mdash;even to <i>these</i> gentlemen." She waved her hand
      toward the jury and there was a widening of her nostrils as if her breath
      and courage were leaving her. "Rather than have him punished, disgraced,
      ruined, I can tell it all. He is <i>not</i> guilty. It is I! It is I!" She
      put her trembling hands to her temples and her eyes were those of a hunted
      creature at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before he came into the world&mdash;you'll let me tell you frankly,
      judge? <i>I must</i>. Before he came into the world I made him what he is&mdash;a
      thief. Did I or did his father? It was like this. I am ashamed to tell it,
      but, oh, judge, I <i>loved</i> him, and I longed to make the pretty things
      and buy the dainty ones that would make his soft, white, dimpled flesh
      look sweeter when he should lie before me. His father was&mdash;you knew
      his father, judge. He was a good man, but&mdash; You know how he loved
      money&mdash;and power. He&mdash; I&mdash; I was the pauper most young
      wives are. I was too proud to ask for money, and if I <i>had</i> asked
      often&mdash; But I was too proud, so, perhaps, I need not tell about the
      if. Most women know it, and&mdash; You could not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. A panic had overtaken her nerves. She was becoming vaguely
      conscious of her position. Her eyes wandered over the room; but when they
      fell upon her son, sitting with his wretched face pinched and startled,
      with his deep eyes staring at her, her courage came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At first I had no thought of theft. I used to go each night after my
      husband fell asleep and take a little money from his pocket. Only a
      little. He never missed it&mdash;never. So he used to whip the boy for
      stealing afterward and said he would disgrace us and&mdash; I never told
      him even then. Life was horrible. The growing certainty maddened me. He
      would steal anything, everything about the house, even his own things. He
      did not understand himself and he could not help it; but I did not think
      it would ever come to <i>this</i>&mdash;through me&mdash;<i>through me!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      She calmed herself again suddenly by a glance at her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every night I took only a little money. My motive was a good one. I knew
      my husband did not understand how I longed to get the pretty things. How&mdash;
      Of course in one sense I had a right to the money. He was rich even then,
      but&mdash;I <i>felt</i> myself a&mdash;pauper&mdash;and a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash; Do you think young mothers should be young paupers, judge? I've
      sometimes thought that if they were not there might be less use for courts
      like this&mdash;and prisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've sometimes thought if mothers sat on juries they'd know the reasons
      why for crime and wrong and, maybe, work to cure the causes of the crimes
      rather than simply punish those who have committed them blindly&mdash;<i>often
      blindly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've sometimes thought the cost&mdash;in money&mdash;would be less; and
      then the cost in love and sorrow! Oh, judge, be patient just a little
      longer. Do not let them stop me. It means so much to <i>us!</i> I'll go
      back to the point. I'll tell the truth&mdash;all of it&mdash;all. But it
      is hard to do it&mdash;here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bought the little wardrobe; but remember, judge, the months and months
      of daily building, bone on bone, fibre within fibre, thought on thought
      that is moulded into shape for human beings!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew your father, judge. Your eyes are like his, but all your mental
      life&mdash;your temperament&mdash;you got from other blood than filled his
      veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father's mother gave you your character. Your gentle heart is hers&mdash;your
      patient thoughtfulness. I knew her well. I knew your mother, too. She was
      the teacher of my motherhood. It was to her I told the truth in my boy's
      childhood&mdash;when I first began to realize or fear what I had done. You
      owe it all to her that you are strong and true. She understood in time&mdash;and
      now you sit in judgment on my boy, whose mother learned from yours too
      late the meaning and the danger of it all. She saved my other children. I
      killed my pride for them. <i>I asked for money</i>. The others may be <i>beggars</i>
      some day&mdash;they never will be thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That boy has never asked a favor. He simply cannot. His pride was always
      stronger than anything&mdash;anything except his love for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knit that in his blood too. I loved him so I made myself a thief for
      him. Of course I did not know&mdash;I did not understand the awful danger
      then; but&mdash; A young mother&mdash;I&mdash;it is hard to tell it here.
      You will not understand&mdash;you cannot. Oh, God, for a mother on the
      jury! A mother on the bench!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught at her escaping courage again. The officer whose duty it was to
      take her away moved forward a second time, and a second time the judge
      motioned him back. She had been his mother's friend ever since he could
      remember, and the ordinary discipline of the court was not for her. He
      would do his duty, he said to himself, but surely there was no haste. All
      this was irregular, of course, but if something should come of it that
      gave excuse for a new trial no one would be more thankful than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young mothers are so ignorant. They know so little of all the things of
      which they should know much. They are so helpless. Judge, there will be
      criminal courts and prisons&mdash;oh, so many of both&mdash;just as long
      as motherhood is ignorant and helpless and swayed by feeling only. Don't
      you know it is ignorance and feeling that leads to crime? If people only
      understood! If only they were able to think it out to what it means,
      crimes would not be&mdash;but they cannot, they cannot! Those trembling
      lips you see before you are no more truly a copy of mine&mdash;the boy is
      as responsible for the set and curve of those lips&mdash;as he is for his
      hopeless fault. He has stolen from his infancy; but I, not he, am the
      thief. Now sentence the real criminal, judge. Courts are to punish the
      guilty&mdash;not to further curse the helpless victims. I am the criminal
      here. Sentence me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother! Mother! I never understood my-self before! Oh, mother, mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild cry from Walter Banks as his mother had risen asking for
      sentence on herself. He sprang forward, forgetting everything and took her
      in his arms. There was a great stir in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence in the court!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Banks had fainted. Her son helped to carry her into another room. No
      one attempted to prevent him. The young prosecutor returned with him and
      stood dumb before the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready for sentence, your Honor. I committed the burglary." It was
      the voice of the prisoner. He was standing with his arms folded and his
      eyes cast down. Silence fell in the room. The women ceased to sob. There
      was an uneasy movement in the jury box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In view of the new evidence&mdash;" began the foreman but the voice of
      the judge, slow and steady, filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the sentence of this court that you, Walter Banks, be confined at
      hard labor in the state penitentiary for the term of four years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner bowed and turned a shade paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not tell mother that until she is better," he said to his attorney and
      passed out in the custody of the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And at the end of four years, what!" a lady was saying to the young
      prosecutor as the room slowly emptied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The brute!" was hurled after the judge by another, as his form vanished
      through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shows that law is not for the poor alone&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good things for social order and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, I'm rather disappointed; but of course a judge can't go behind
      the returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidence all one way if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens, what a scene!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;my opinion no woman should ever be admitted to a court room except
      as a prisoner. It&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feather in the cap of the prosecutor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;re-election sure enough now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whole thing in a nutshell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simple question. <i>Did</i> he commit the burglary? If so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prosecutor hurried away from the sound of these voices and the
      congratulations of his political friends. He was mentally sore and
      perplexed because he had won his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he called upon the prisoner for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made up' my mind to resign my office," he said, not looking at the
      convict, who had risen to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Banks was by far the calmer of the two, but he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never be able to act for the prosecution again. I thought this
      case was so clear. My duty seemed so plain&mdash;too plain to admit of
      anything but the most vigorous course of action; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did nothing but your duty, Mathews. We are all victims I suppose&mdash;one
      way or another. You are going to be the victim of your sensitive
      conscience. The result will be a course of vacillation that will ruin your
      chances of success. I am sorry. You've got all the elements for a leader&mdash;only
      you've got a conscience. That settles it. A bit of heredity like that is
      as fatal as&mdash;as mine." He bit his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let your part in my case worry you. The game of life has gone
      against me. That is all. The dice were loaded before I ever got hold of
      them. I did what I could to out-live&mdash;out-fight my awful&mdash;inheritance.
      I wasn't strong enough. It got the best of me. Nature is a terrible
      antagonist. Perhaps now that I understand myself better I shall be able to
      keep a firmer hold. You did your duty, Mathews; good-by. Be&mdash; Can't
      you be a little kind to mother? She suffers so. Her punishment is double&mdash;and
      her crime was ignorance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he took the hand that was held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only ignorance," he added. "It seems an awful punishment for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ignorance&mdash;and poverty and love," said the young prosecutor as the
      door closed behind him, "and Nature did the rest! What a grip is at our
      throats! And how we help blind Nature in her cruel work by laws and
      customs and conditions! What a little way we've come from barbarism yet!
      How slow we travel. But we are moving," he added with a deep sigh. "Moving
      a little. There is light ahead. If not for us, then for those who come
      after."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the bolt slip behind him and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might as easily have been I," he mused as he went down the steps, and
      shuddered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt if it was fault of his or virtue of mine that determined which of
      us two should be the prosecutor."

    <p>
      When I called, last Sunday afternoon, as was my habit, upon my old college
      friend&mdash;now a distinguished physician&mdash;I found him sitting in
      his office holding in his hand a letter. His manner was unusually grave
      and, I thought, troubled. I asked him, laughingly, if he had had bad news
      from beyond the seas&mdash;from his Castle in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is worse than that, I fear," he said gravely. "It looks to me very
      much like bad news from beyond the grave&mdash;from the Castle of Heredity
      in the realm of an Ancestor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, doctor, that you have not had,&mdash;that my little jest was not
      a cruel touch upon a real hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all, old fellow," he said, smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not my own trouble at all; but&mdash;well, it set me to thinking
      strange thoughts. Shall I tell you about it? I should really like to know
      just how it would impress you&mdash;an intelligent man out of the
      profession."
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the letter on the table beside him, looked at me steadily for a
      moment, and then began:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be as well to say that I have never before ventured to tell the
      story of George Wetherell's curious experience, simply because I have
      always felt certain that to a really intelligent and well-in-formed
      physician it would be a comparatively familiar, and not specially
      startling (although a wholly uncomprehended) phase of human disorder;
      while to many, not of the profession, it would appear to involve such
      fearful and far-reaching results, that they would either refuse to believe
      it possible at all, or else jump to the conclusion that numerous cases
      which have only some slight point of similarity are to be classed with it
      and explained upon the same basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In regard to these latter persons, I do not intend to convey the
      impression that I am either ambitious to shield them from the consequences
      of their own nimble and unguarded reckonings, or that by my silence in
      this particular instance I suppose that I have prevented them from forming
      quite as erroneous opinions founded upon some other equally misunderstood
      and ill-digested scrap of psychological and medical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it has sometimes seemed to me that there were certain features
      connected with the case of George Wetherell which, in the hands of the
      ignorant or unscrupulous, might easily be used to the disadvantage of
      their fellow-beings, and I have therefore hesitated to lay it before any
      one who was not, in my opinion, both intelligent and honorable enough to
      accept it as one of the strange manifestations in an individual
      experience; and to understand, because of the innumerable conditions of
      mental and physical heredity&mdash;which were not likely ever to occur
      again in the same proportions&mdash;that therefore the same manifestations
      were, not to be looked for in a sufficient number of persons to ever make
      this case in any sense a type or a guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notwithstanding this, there are, as I said in the first place, certain
      features connected with it which many members of the medical profession
      will recognize; but they are none the less puzzling symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The matter has been brought back with unusual force to my mind at this
      time, by a circumstance connected with one of Wetherell's children, which
      is detailed in this letter. It lends a new touch of interest to the malady
      of the father. To enable you to obtain even a fairly comprehensive idea of
      the strange development, it will be necessary for me to tell you, first,
      something about the man and his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be as brief as I may, then, he was the son of a merry, whole-souled,
      stout, and, withal, mentally alert, Southern gentleman, who had taken the
      law into his own hands and duly scandalized the reputable part of the
      community in which he lived by giving his slaves (all of whom he or his
      wife had inherited) their freedom at a time and under circumstances which
      made it necessary for him to betake himself with some considerable
      alacrity to a part of the country where it was looked upon as respectable
      to pay for the voluntary services of one's fellowmen, rather than to pay
      for the man himself with the expectation that the services were to be
      thrown in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it was imperative&mdash;not only for the peace, but for the
      safety of all parties concerned&mdash;for him to transport both his family
      and his freed-men to a place where it was at once honorable for a white
      man to do such a deed and for a black man to own himself. This he did; and
      while a number of the negroes remained in the service of the family, the
      son (on whose account, and to prevent whom from believing in and being
      enervated by the possession of slaves the step had, in great measure, been
      taken) had grown to manhood with a curious mingling of Southern sympathies
      and Northern reasoning and convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The outbreak of the war found the young fellow struggling bravely, with
      all the fire and energy of a peculiarly gifted nature, to establish a
      newspaper in a border State, and to convince his readers that the
      extension of slavery would be a grave calamity, not only for the owned but
      for the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His two associates were Eastern college-bred men, and it was therefore
      deemed wisest to push young Wetherell forward as the special champion of
      free soil, under the illusion that his Southern birth and sympathies would
      win for him a more ready and kindly hearing on a subject which at that
      time was a dangerous one to handle freely, especially in the border-land
      then under dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the three young enthusiasts had reckoned, as young people will, upon
      a certain degree of reason about, and calm discussion of, a question which
      at that time they still recognized as having two very strong and serious
      sides; for they had not taken the stand of the Abolition party at all.
      They called themselves free-soil Democrats, and were simply arguing
      against the extension of an institution which they were not yet prepared
      to believe it wise to attempt to abolish where it was already established,
      and where there was seemingly no other peaceable or fair solution than the
      one of limitation and gradual emancipation, through the process of mental
      and moral development of the ruling race. This position was not an
      unnatural one, surely, for young Wetherell, and was only what might have
      been expected from the son of a man who had given practical demonstration
      of the possibility of such evolution in the slave-holding and
      slave-dependent class.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, as I have intimated, the confidence and reasonableness of youth had
      led to a complete misconception as to the temper of the opposition. It is
      quite possible that the frank, passionate, free-soil editorials, if they
      had come from either of the Eastern men, might have been accepted as the
      delusions of youth, the prejudice of section, or, at worst, as the
      arguments of partisans; but from a man of Southern birth&mdash;the son of
      a law-breaker (you must remember that the enfranchisement of the slaves
      had been a serious infraction of the law, strange as that sounds to the
      ears of the present generation)&mdash;from the son of such a man they
      could mean only a malicious desire to stir up strife and cause bloodshed
      by making restless slaves dangerous and dangerous slaves desperate. The
      result was that one night, after the issue of a paper containing an
      article of unusual force and power, young Wetherell found himself startled
      from a sound sleep, in the back room of his office, by the smell of smoke
      and gleam of flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He understood their significance at a glance, and knew that escape by the
      front door meant a reception by masked men, five minutes for prayer, and&mdash;a
      rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Springing from the back window into the river, he swam to the other
      shore, and within a few days raised the first regiment of volunteers that
      the State sent in response to the call of the President, and cut adrift at
      once and forever from all effort to argue the case from an ethical or a
      financial outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is more than likely that anger may have had something to do with his
      sudden conversion from a 'peace and argument,' to first a 'war Democrat,'
      and shortly thereafter to a Republican; but be that as it may, it is
      certain that at such crises as these, mental activity is spurred and
      radical changes are made with a rapidity and decision astonishing to
      contemplate in periods of quiet and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it came about that this lad of twenty-three suddenly found himself at
      the head of a regiment of somewhat desperate border men, most of whom were
      more than twice his own age, wildly charging a battery in one of the first
      battles of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He received three wounds, one of which was a slight abrasion of the
      scalp, not looked upon as more than a scratch by either the surgeon or
      himself; indeed, it would hardly be worth mentioning but for the strange
      events which followed. Whether this wound had anything to do with the
      condition of which I am about to tell, you will have to decide for
      yourself; but I must warn you, in the beginning, that there was nothing
      like a fracture of the skull, and the little path made by the bullet
      through the scalp healed without trouble, almost without attention, and
      never afterward gave the slightest pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hair, it is true, did not grow again over the parting, and, as it was
      nearly in the middle of his head, it made him an involuntary follower of
      the fashion of a certain effeminate type of youths for whom he had an
      overwhelming contempt. Neither of the other two wounds was serious, and
      after a very short period in the hospital he reported for duty, was
      promoted, and given sole charge of a post of considerable importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shortly thereafter his father received a some what discomposing telegram.
      He had previously had several more or less lucid despatches from his son
      while the patient was still in the hospital; but any lack of clearness in
      their wording had been attributed to haste or to carelessness in the
      transmission, and as they all indicated rapid recovery, no undue anxiety
      had been felt. But the message in question now produced the impression
      that there was something wrong. It read: 'Send me one thousand swords
      immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After a few moments' consultation with the boy's mother, Mr. Wetherell
      packed his hand-bag, and, armed with a letter from President Lincoln,
      whose personal friend he was, started for the seat of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon arriving at his destination, the son expressed no surprise whatever,
      but much pleasure, at seeing his father. He asked, in the most natural and
      affectionate way, about each member of the family, and then suddenly put
      his hand to his head and appeared to be in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His eyes contracted in the manner peculiar to some persons when
      attempting to recall a long-forgotten event; but in a moment this had
      passed away and he appeared to be perfectly clear and natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He attended to the affairs of his office in a manner which not only
      escaped criticism, but won praise from his superiors, and conversed with
      great freedom and marked intelligence on the stirring subjects of the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had had some little fever while his wounds were fresh, but in no
      degree to cause alarm, and even this had now almost entirely left him. In
      short, he appeared to be in nearly perfect mental and physical health.
      There was, however, one peculiarity which the father noticed as unfamiliar
      in his son; but as it was not at all strange that so young a man&mdash;or
      any man, indeed, who had suddenly been given control of matters of such
      grave importance&mdash;should at times be very quiet and appear to be
      struggling to recall some matter of moment, the habit was not given more
      than passing attention, and it was not sufficiently marked to be noticed
      at all by any one except a near relation. At these times young Wetherell
      would contract his eyebrows, look steadily at some object near him,&mdash;as
      the toe of his boot or the palm of his hand,&mdash;raise his head
      suddenly, gaze at the distant horizon, bite his lip, and then appear to
      either give it up or be satisfied with some mental solution of his puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day his father said: 'What is it, George?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young fellow turned his eyes quickly upon his father and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Have I forgotten anything? It seems to me there is something I just fail
      to recall. I am on the edge of it constantly, but it slips. I can't get
      quite enough hold on it to be sure what it is&mdash;or to be certain,
      indeed, that it is anything. Can you think of anything I ought to do that
      I have overlooked?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This all sounded natural enough, and was, seemingly, a condition not
      unfamiliar to his father, so they began together going over the duties
      pertaining to the son's office to see if, by a mischance, something had
      been neglected. Everything was complete and in perfect order; but still
      the look returned from time to time, until it became almost habitual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was ten days after his father had reached camp, and his plan was to
      leave for home that afternoon; for, as I said, the boy's wounds were
      almost entirely healed, and he appeared to be in need of nothing whatever.
      More and more his superior officers called him into their councils, and
      more and more his clear judgment was commended by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was to walk to the train with his father. The moment they were outside
      the limits of the camp George remarked, casually, 'I must stop on the way
      and order those swords.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The remark recalled the queer telegram which had caused Mr. Wetherell to
      come to his son, the wording of which had been wholly obliterated from his
      mind by their meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What swords?' inquired his father, now on the alert again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young fellow turned and looked at his father for a moment, and then
      said: 'I don't know. It is a secret order. Don't mention it. The general
      told me to order them. They are to be sent to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This all seemed probable enough to Mr. Wetherell, and yet he somehow
      felt, rather than saw, a queer change in his son's eyes, which he thought
      he had noticed once or twice before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He decided not to return home for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he told his son this, the boy took it quite as a matter of course,
      and made no comment whatever on the sudden alteration of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the way back to camp George stepped into a military supply station and
      ordered fourteen hundred swords to be delivered to him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By this time his father had made up his mind that there were short
      intervals in which the young colonel did not know exactly what he was
      doing&mdash;or, rather, that while he did know and act intelligently&mdash;from
      the outlook of the moment&mdash;it was a time wholly disconnected from the
      rest of his life, and when the moment was past he had no farther
      recollection of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, Mr. Wetherell was not sure enough of this to risk compromising a
      probably brilliant future by a premature or unnecessarily public
      announcement, and he therefore allowed the order to be made, and taken in
      good faith, and walked back to camp with his son, who immediately went
      about his duties in the most intelligent and scrupulously careful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Wetherell, however, made a call upon the officer in command the
      moment he could do so without attracting attention; and after a long talk
      (in which the secret sword order was discovered to be a delusion), it was
      decided that the recently recovered invalid should retire from the field
      on the sick leave, which he had previously refused to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he was told of this arrangement, he agreed to it without a murmur,
      and began, for the first time for many days, to have his wounds (which
      were now past the need of it) dressed with much care. This he continued
      every morning, but by the time they reached home he had become possessed
      with the belief that his chief wound was in his side, where there had not
      been a scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To humor him, the family physician applied bandages to the imaginary
      injury every day regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this time there was no clearer talker, no more acute reasoner, no
      more simple, earnest, gentlemanly fellow to be found than Col. George
      Wetherell, whom his townsmen were honoring and inducing to make public
      speeches and write clear, firm, inspiring editorials for one of the
      leading papers. No one except his own family and physician suspected for a
      moment that he was not mentally as bright as he always had been, and even
      the younger members of the family were without the least hint of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, his father and the doctor both thought that his only illusion now
      was a belief in the wound in his side. Several weeks passed, and even this
      indication was losing its force, for he no longer required medical
      attention, and was as well and as rational as ever in his life, so far as
      any one could perceive, when one day a stranger appeared and asked for
      him. Mr. Wetherell requested the gentleman (who was evidently laboring
      under great excitement) to be seated, and at the same time made up his own
      mind to be present during the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel Wetherell was summoned, and, on entering the room, looked in a
      startled way at the stranger, smiled vaguely, extended his hand,
      contracted his eyes into a long, narrow line, turned white, and throwing
      both arms suddenly above his head, exclaimed: 'My God! my God! what have I
      done? Where am I? How long has it been? Is she dead? Is she dead?' and
      staggered back into his father's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His distress was so manifest, that the visitor lost his severity at once,
      and said quite gently: 'No, she is not dead; but she is almost insane with
      fright, and has been so exhausted with anxiety and tears, that we had lost
      all hope for her reason, or even for her life, unless I could find you. I
      have been through the lines, was delayed by the loss of my passport, and
      it is now five weeks since I saw her. She is alive, but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Wetherell sprang to his feet, and turned on his father like a
      madman. 'How dared you?' he demanded; 'how dared you keep back my letters?
      You have killed her. You have murdered her, poor, delicate girl, with
      anxiety and doubt of me.' And then with set teeth and white lips he
      advanced upon his father, his arm uplifted, as if he held a sword, and
      with a sweep which would have severed chords of steel, if the weapon had
      really been within his grasp, he brought his arm across his father's
      breast and sank upon the floor, senseless and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afterward, when he revived, he had no recollection of what had occurred,
      except alone the fact that for many weeks previous he had forgotten
      utterly the girl who was to be his wife, whose life and love were all his
      world. While he had remembered everything else, had carefully attended to
      the smallest details of daily life, the link of memory that held the fact
      of her existence had been coated with a rust of absolute oblivion. The
      single link in all the chain of memory that had failed him had been the
      one the nearest to his heart&mdash;the dearest one of all!
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were married two months later, and he resumed command of his
      regiment. Through an honorable and eventful life no sign of mental lapse
      ever returned; but every day he dreaded it, and watched his wife and
      children as a man might do who saw a creeping monster back of those he
      loved while he stood paralyzed and dumb. He never seemed to fear that
      other things might lose their hold upon his consciousness; but the
      apprehension that his mind would slip the link which held his wife, and
      leave her sick and faint with anxious fears, which he alone could still,
      constantly haunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wounds never troubled him again. He died not long ago. His career was
      an exceptionally brilliant one. You would know him if I had given his real
      name, for it was in the public ear for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were but six persons who ever knew the history of his case, and
      they are still unable to explain it&mdash;its cause, its direction, its
      cure. Or is it cured? Will his children be subject to it? Will it take the
      same form? Was it caused by the wound? by the fever? Or were hereditary
      conditions so grouped as to produce this mental effect, even if there had
      been no wound&mdash;no illness? If the latter, will it be transmitted?
      These questions come to me with renewed force, to-day, as I hold in my
      hand this letter, asking me to give the family history of Col. George
      Wetherell for the use of physicians in a distant city who are now treating
      his son. This son has reached the precise age at which his father had the
      strange experience of which I have just told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a hint in the letter which, in the light of the father's malady,
      appears to a physician to be of peculiar importance from a medical
      outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see, we shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause; then he asked: "Should you, a layman, look to the
      wound to explain the condition? Or to the Castle of Heredity? Suppose the
      son's malady is quite similar&mdash;as now appears&mdash;what then?"

    <p>
      Mr. John Boler had been in the hotel business, as he phrased it, ever
      since he was born. Before he could walk he had been the "feature" of his
      father's summer hotel, where he was the only baby to be passed around and
      hugged into semi-unconsciousness by all the women in the house. Because of
      the scarcity of his kind, too, he was subjected to untold agony by the
      male guests, most of whom appeared to believe that the chief desire of his
      infantile heart was to be tossed skyward from hour to hour and caught in
      upstretched hands as he descended with a sickening sense of insecurity and
      a wild hysterical laugh. In these later years he often said that he would
      like to know who those summer fiends were who had made his infancy so full
      of narrow escapes from sudden and violent death. Finally he thought he had
      revenge at hand. A benevolent-looking old gentleman came puffing up to the
      desk of the Boler House, and, after registering, proceeded to question the
      genial proprietor as to his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, dear me," he puffed, "and so you are the son of old John Boler,
      the best hotel-keeper the sun ever shone upon! Why, I remember tossing you
      up to the rafters under the porch of your father's house when you were
      only the size of a baked apple and mighty nigh as measly looking. Well,
      well, to be sure you had grit for a young one. Never got scared. Always
      yelled for more. I believe if you had batted your soft little head against
      the roof you'd have laughed all the louder and kicked until you did it
      again," and the old man chuckled with the pleasure of age and
      retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember well," said Mr. Boler, casting about in his own mind for
      the form of revenge he should take on this man now that he was to have the
      chance for which he had so longed and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought was to put him in the room next to the three sporting
      men who played poker and told questionable stories of their own exploits
      after two o'clock every night, but that hardly seemed adequate. The room
      adjoining the elevator popped into his head. Every time the old gentleman
      fell asleep <i>bang</i> would go that elevator door or <i>bzzzz</i> would
      start off the bell so suddenly that it would leave him unnerved and
      frantic in the morning. But what was that? What John Boler yearned for was
      to make the punishment fit the crime, and, after all these years of
      planning and wishing for the chance, here it was, and he felt that he
      could think of nothing, absolutely nothing, bad enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with a fine satire which was wholly lost upon his victim, Mr. Boler
      ordered him taken to the very best room in the house, and made up his mind
      that after disarming all suspicion in that way he would set about his
      revenge, which should take some exquisitely torturous form.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had run through his mind with great rapidity while the old
      gentleman talked. Then Mr. Boler turned the register around, wrote "98"
      opposite the name. Said he should be delighted to show his own mettle to
      one of his father's old guests, called out "Front," and transferred his
      attention to a sweet-faced girl who stood waiting her turn to register.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A small room, please," she said in a voice scarcely above a whisper. Mr.
      Boler knew just what it meant in an instant. He knew that she was not used
      to hotels&mdash;that she was uncertain what to do, and that she wanted her
      living to cost her as little as possible. She was evidently a lady, and
      quite as evidently from some small town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Front," he called again. "Show this lady to 96. Step lively." Front
      grinned. Ninety-six was a mere closet with no window except one facing a
      dark shaft. Indeed, it had once been the dressing-room and clothes press
      for the adjoining suite, and so far as Front could remember had never been
      used as a sleeping apartment by any one except the valet of a certain
      French gentleman who once occupied 98.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Took my revenge on the wrong person that time," mused Mr. Boler as he saw
      the lady enter the elevator. "Now I wonder why I did that?" But Mr. John
      Boler had his little superstition, as most of us have, and whenever he was
      moved by a perfectly blind impulse to do a thing, he always believed that
      "something would come of it sure," as he expressed it. "Never knew it to
      fail. Of course I don't believe in such things; but&mdash;" and then he
      would laugh and go on believing in it as implicitly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day he brooded over what he should do to old Winkle, as he called the
      man in 98, and as surely as his mind grew exhausted and his various plans
      fell through, his thoughts would catch a glimpse of the timid girl in the
      next room, and he would smilingly wink to himself and say, "Something will
      come of it, something will come of it sure. Never put a guest in that
      beastly room before, and I had nothing against <i>her. Must</i> have been
      him It was after." He always called his blind impulses "It" when he was
      utilizing them for superstitious purposes or to quiet his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bet that girl being in that closet will be the means of getting me
      even with old Winkle yet, and she is not used to city hotels. She'll think
      that it is all right and she will most likely be out all day. It's not so
      bad to sleep in after all. Quietest room in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Winkle strolled into the office and harassed Mr.
      Boler about his infancy, reminding him that he had possessed a very weak
      stomach. "And who wouldn't," thought that gentleman indignantly, "if he
      was pitched about like a bale of hay from morning till night by every fool
      that got hold of him?" but he smiled pleasantly and said no doubt he had
      been very much like other infants, judging from the way he grew up. He
      looked upon a baby as the embryonic man, and as he was about an average
      adult male biped now, he had most likely been very close to an average
      male infant. "I might have been more," he hinted darkly, "but for certain
      idiotic people," and then he laughed. For it was not in Mr. John Boler's
      nature to be openly unpleasant to any one. This was the secret of his
      success as an innkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, Johnnie," said old Mr. Winkle late the next afternoon, "I
      thought I heard some one sobbing in the room next to mine last night. This
      morning I concluded I was mistaken, but now I'm sure I heard it. Anybody
      sick in there? I tried the door that leads into my room but it was locked.
      It sounds like a woman's voice. It always did tear the very heart out of
      me to hear a woman cry&mdash;" He went on talking but Mr. John Boler heard
      no more. His heart gave a wild bound of delight. "It" had given him his
      revenge. He would let the young woman stay in the hotel free of charge as
      long as old Winkle was in the house if only she would weep and sob pretty
      steadily. "'Johnnie,' by gad," thought he, resenting this new indignity to
      his name. "By George, what luck!" And then he went about his duties with a
      new spring in his always elastic step. At the lunch hour the following day
      he glanced into the dining-room, and sure enough, there sat the occupant
      of 96, and her eyes were swollen and red. At almost any other time this
      would have disturbed John Boler, but now it was a deep delight to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a spat with her lover, no doubt," speculated he, "and, by Jove! it
      came at a lucky time for me. I'd pay her lover to keep up the row for
      three weeks if I could get at him. 'Weak stomach,' 'Johnnie,' indeed!" And
      he went back to the office rubbing his hands in a satisfied way, thinking
      that old Winkle would be afraid to go to his room that night, and that his
      sleep would be broken by visions of a weeping woman next door, even if she
      did not keep him awake half the time sobbing because Ralph had called her
      a mean thing or a proud stuck-up flirt, and hinted darkly that she was in
      love with his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters had gone on in this way for nearly a week and Mr. Winkle had
      fretted and fumed and asked for another room two or three times, but Mr.
      Boler told him that the house was full and that there wasn't another room
      fit to offer him anyhow. He said that he would change the young lady's
      room as soon as he could, but he expected her to leave every day. She went
      out a good deal and wrote a large number of letters, and he felt sure she
      was going to remain only a day or two longer. He apologized and explained
      and planned, and then he would chuckle to himself the moment "old
      Winkle's" back was turned to think how "<i>It</i>" had succeeded in
      getting him even with the old reprobate without the least overt act on his
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the eighth morning Mr. Winkle rebelled outright. He said that he would
      wring the girl's worthless neck if he could get at her, but he could not
      and would not bear her sobs any longer. The night before they had been
      worse than ever and he had not slept a wink all night long. At last Mr.
      Boler promised that he would transfer the girl to another room that very
      afternoon if she did not leave, and the old man softened at once and said
      if she could not afford to pay for any other room he would pay the
      difference and she need never know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Boler was not mercenary, but this offer gave him keen delight. For
      "old Winkle" would have to buy his relief after all. He thought how
      willingly a certain infant of his memory would have paid for rest and
      quiet too when it was helpless clay in the hands of certain old imbeciles
      he knew of.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 2 p.m. he told Front to go up to 96 and tell the young lady that he now
      had a better room for her that would cost her no more than the one she now
      occupied, and to change her and her belongings to 342 forthwith. In five
      minutes Front came back as white as a cloth and said that the young lady's
      door was unlocked, that there were a number of letters on the table and
      that she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Boler dashed from behind the desk across the street and was back
      in an incredibly short space of time, dragging behind him the dignified
      and wealthy physician whose office faced the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage of the proceedings he cautioned the employees not to say a
      word about the matter on pain of instant dismissal. They one and all
      promised, and then proceeded to tell the first reporter who dropped in
      that a young lady had committed suicide upstairs and that she had cried
      out loud for a week. They gave a full description of her and her effects,
      all of which appeared in the 5 o'clock edition of the paper, duly
      headlined with her name and certain gratuitous speculations in regard to
      her motive for self-destruction. In these it was darkly hinted that she
      was no better than she should be, but now that she was dead "we" (the
      immaculate young gentlemen of the press) felt disposed to draw a veil of
      charity over her past and say with the law that her suicide proved her
      insanity, and that her mental condition might also account for her past
      frailties.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these generous young gentlemen were penning their reports the doctor
      and Mr. John Boler worked over the poor helpless body of the unconscious
      girl in the dark little room upstairs. Between times they read the letters
      on the table and learned the old, old story&mdash;not of crime, but of
      misfortune. No work had offered, and she must work or starve&mdash;or sell
      the only value she possessed in the sight of men. One or two of the
      answers to her advertisement had boldly hinted at this, and when her
      little stock of money had run out and the little stock of misfortune had
      swelled into a mountain, and the little pile of insults had increased
      until she felt that she could endure life no longer, she had concluded to
      brave another world where she was taught to believe a loving Father
      awaited her because she had been good and true and pure to the last in
      spite of storms and disappointments and temptations. So she made the wild
      leap in the dark, confident that the hereafter could hold nothing worse,
      and believing sincerely that it must hold something better for Her and her
      kind, even if that better were only forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this point her story was that of thousands of helpless girls who
      face the unknown dangers of a great city with the confidence of youth, and
      that ill training and ignorance of the world which is supposed to be a
      part of the charm of young womanhood. She had not registered her real
      name, it is true; but this was because she intended to advertise for work
      and have the replies sent to the hotel, and somehow she thought that it
      would be easier for her to do that over a name less sacred to her than her
      mother's, which was also her own. So instead of registering as Fannie
      Ellis Worth of Atlanta, she had written "Miss Kate Jarvis" and had given
      no address whatever. This latter fact told strongly against her with the
      reporters. They located her in a certain house on Thirty-first Street and
      "interviewed" the madam, who gave them a picture of a girl who had once
      been there, and a cut of this picture appeared in two of the morning
      papers with the fuller account of the suicide. A beautiful moral was
      appended to this history of the girl's life "which had now come to its
      appropriate ending." But when one of these enterprising young gentlemen of
      the press called to get the details of the funeral for his paper, he was
      shocked to learn that the young lady was not dead after all, and that she
      was now in a fair way to recover. He was still further disgusted when
      neither Mr. Boler nor the attending physician would submit to an interview
      and declined to allow him to send his card to the girl's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then and there he made up his mind that if he had to rewrite that
      two-column report to fit the new developments in the case, he would, as he
      expressed it, make John Boler and pompous Dr. Ralston wish that they had
      never been bom. Incident to this undertaking, he would darkly hint at a
      number of things in regard to the girl herself and their relations with
      her. This was not at all to make her wish that she had never been born;
      but if it should serve that purpose, the young gentleman did not feel that
      he would be in the least to blame&mdash;if, indeed, he gave the matter a
      thought at all, which he very likely did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article he wrote was certainly very "wide awake" and surprised even
      himself in its ingenuity of conjecture as to the motive which could prompt
      two such men as John Boler, proprietor of the Boler House, and Dr.
      Ralston, "whose reputation had heretofore been above suspicion, to place
      themselves in so unenviable, not to say dangerous, a position." He
      suggested that although the young woman had taken her case out of the
      jurisdiction of the coroner by not actually dying, this fact did not
      relieve the affair of certain features which demanded the prompt attention
      of the police court. The matter was perfectly clear. Here was a young
      woman who had attempted to relieve herself, by rapid means, of the life
      which all the social and financial conditions which surrounded her had
      combined to take by a slower and more painful process. If she had
      succeeded, the law held that she was of unsound mind&mdash;that she was,
      in short, a lunatic&mdash;and treated her case accordingly; but, on the
      other hand, if she failed, or if, as in this instance, her effort to place
      herself beyond want and pain was thwarted by others, then the law was
      equally sure that she was <i>not</i> a lunatic at all, but that she was a
      criminal, and that it was the plain duty of the police judge to see that
      she was put with those of her class&mdash;the enemies and outcasts of
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also quite clear that any one who aided, abetted, or shielded a
      criminal was <i>particeps criminis,</i> and that unless Mr. John Boler and
      Dr. Ralston turned the young offender over to the police at once, there
      was a virtuous young reporter on the <i>Daily Screamer</i> who intended to
      know the reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this article in the <i>Screamer</i> which first made Mr. Winkle
      aware of the condition of affairs in the room adjoining his own. He had
      been absent from the hotel for some hours, and had, therefore, known
      nothing of the sad happenings so near him. He dashed down into the office
      with the paper in his hand and asked for Mr. Boler; but that gentleman was
      not visible. It was said that he was in consultation with Dr. Ralston at
      the office of the latter, whereupon Mr. Winkle re-read the entire article
      aloud to the imperturbable clerk and expressed himself as under the
      impression that something was the matter with the law, or else that a
      certain reporter for the <i>Screamer</i> was the most dangerous lunatic at
      present outside of the legislature. The clerk smiled. A young man leaning
      against the desk made a note on a tablet, and then asked Mr. Winkle what
      he knew of the case and to state his objections to the law, first saying
      <i>which</i> law he so vigorously disapproved. The clerk winked at Mr.
      Winkle, but Mr. Winkle either did not see, or else did not regard the
      purport of the demonstration, and proceeded to express himself with a good
      deal of emphasis in regard to a condition of affairs which made it
      possible to elect as lawmakers men capable of framing such idiotic
      measures and employing on newspapers others who upheld the enactment. But
      before he had gone far in these strictures on public affairs as now
      administered he espied John Boler and followed him hastily upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Mr. Winkle almost fell from his chair when he saw the
      evening edition of the <i>Screamer</i> with a three-column "interview"
      with himself. It was headed, "<i>Rank Socialism at the Boler House. A
      Close Friend of the Offending Landlord Lets the Cat out of the Bag. A
      Dangerous Nest of Law Breakers. John Boler and Dr. Ralston still Defiant.
      Backed by a Man Who Ought to Know Better. Shameless Confession of one of
      the Arch Conspirators. The Mask torn from Old Silas Winkle Who Roomed Next
      to the Would-be Suicide. Will the Police Act Now?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Winkle read the article appended to these startling headlines, he
      descended hastily to the office floor and proceeded to make some remarks
      which it would be safe to assert would not be repeated by any
      Sunday-school superintendent&mdash;in the presence of his class&mdash;in
      the confines of the State of New York. John Boler was present at the time
      and whispered aside to Mr. Winkle that a reporter for the <i>Screamer</i>
      and five others from as many different papers were within hearing,
      whereupon Mr. Winkle became more and more excited, and talked with great
      volubility to each and every one of the young men as they gathered about
      him. "<i>Adds Blasphemy to His Other Crimes</i>," wrote one of them as his
      headline, and then John Boler interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, boys," said he pleasantly, but with a ring of determination in
      his voice, "you just let Mr. Winkle alone. This sort of thing is all new
      to him, and he had no more to do with that girl than if his room had been
      in Texas." (The reporters winked at each other and one of them wrote, <i>Connived
      at by the Proprietor</i>.) "I put her in the room next to his. <i>I</i>
      helped the doctor to resuscitate her. <i>I</i> positively refuse to give
      you her real name and present address, although I know both, and Mr.
      Winkle does not, and if the police court has any use for me it knows where
      to find me. Have a cigar?" Each reporter took a weed, and three of them
      went to the office of Dr. Ralston to complete their records as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry all this has happened to you in my house, Mr. Winkle," said
      John Boler, as they stood alone for a moment. "It is partly my fault,
      too," he added, in a sudden burst of contrition. "It" had carried his
      revenge further than he had intended. He knew how the old man's sudden
      outbreak of righteous indignation would go against him in the newspaper
      reports that would follow, and John Boler was kind-hearted as well as
      fearless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord, don't you worry about me, Johnnie!" said the old man, craning
      his neck to watch the retreating forms from the window. "But those young
      devils have gone over to the doctor's office and they'll bully him into
      telling where the girl is, and then they'll bully the police into dragging
      her into court yet. Dear me, dear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't you be scared about that, Mr. Winkle. The doctor and I have
      made up our minds to fight this thing out. We've found out all about the
      girl and that it was simply a case of utter despair. It was a question of
      death by slow or by quick means. Society, law, prescribed the slow method,
      and the girl herself chose the rapid one. Well, now, as long as she was to
      be the sufferer in either case, it strikes me that she had about as good a
      right to a voice in the matter as the rest of us. Dr. Ralston and I
      checkmated her. (I can't afford to have that kind of thing happen in the
      hotel, of course.) But, by gad, we're not going to let them make a
      criminal of her. All the circumstances combined to do that before and she
      chose death. Well, we stopped her efforts in that line too, and now the
      court proposes to put the finishing touches on society's other
      inhumanities and send her up for it. Why, good God, man, just look at it!
      In substance that girl said, 'I'll die before I'll be forced into
      association with criminals,' and the court says, 'You shall do nothing of
      the kind. Science shall doctor you up and we will <i>send</i> you up.
      Despair is a crime.' That girl tried every way she knew of to live right.
      She failed. No work that she could do came her way. Well, now, will you
      just tell me what she was to do? You know what any man on God's earth
      would do if <i>he</i> had been situated that way and <i>could</i> have
      sold his virtue&mdash;in the sense we use virtue for women. Well, some
      women are not built that way. They prefer to die. Life don't mean enough
      of happiness to them to pay for the rest of it&mdash;life as it is, I
      mean. Well, since women don't have anything to say about what the laws and
      social conditions shall be, it strikes me that the situation is a trifle
      arbitrary, to put it mildly. We make laws for and demands upon women that
      no man on earth would think of complying with, and then we tell 'em they
      sha'n't even die to get away from the conditions we impose and about which
      they are not allowed a word to say. To tell you the bald truth <i>I'm</i>
      ashamed of it. So when we learned that girl's story we just made up our
      minds that since we had taken the liberty to keep her from getting out of
      the world by a shorter cut than the one usually prescribed in such cases&mdash;starvation&mdash;that
      we'd just take the additional liberty of keeping her from being hounded to
      insanity and made a criminal of by legal verdict."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle gave a snort that startled John Boler, for he had been running
      on half to himself during the last of his talk and had almost forgotten
      that the old man was present. When he heard the explosion he mistook its
      meaning and his conscience gave him another smart twinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm sorry, <i>very</i> sorry, Mr. Winkle, that this trouble has come
      to you in my house, but who could have foreseen that&mdash;a&mdash;that is
      to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble to <i>me?</i>" exclaimed Mr. Winkle. "Trouble to <i>me?</i> Who's
      said anything about any trouble to me? Do you suppose I care what those
      young scamps say about me in the papers? Got to make a living, haven't
      they? Well, society doesn't object to their making a living by taking what
      does not belong to 'em, if it happens to be a man's reputation or a
      woman's chance to ever make an honest living again. Little thefts like
      that don't count That is not a crime; but dear me, Johnnie, do you suppose
      I care a tinker's dam about that, so for as <i>I</i> go? God bless my
      soul, if the dear boys can sell their three columns of rot about me, and
      it will keep them off the heels of some poor devil that it might ruin,
      why, I'm satisfied. All I've got to say to you is, if they arrest you I'll
      go bail, and if they fine you I'll pay it, and if they jail you&mdash;hang
      it, Johnnie, I'll serve your term, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boler laughed. "My punishment shall all be vicarious then, hey? Good
      idea, only it won't work in every-day life. The law doesn't let other
      people serve out your term. But I'm just as much obliged, and&mdash;and&mdash;to
      tell you the truth, Mr. Winkle, I'm&mdash;that is to say, I hope you will
      forgive me&mdash;the fact is, I forgive you freely for the part you took
      in helping to addle such brains as I had when I was a child. There is my
      hand. 'It' went a little too far this time, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle took off his glasses and polished them carefully. Then he
      placed them astride his nose and gazed thoughtfully at his old friend's
      son for fully a minute before he said a word. Finally he took the extended
      hand, shook it solemnly, and walked slowly away, wondering to himself if
      it could be possible that hard-headed old John Boler's son was touched a
      little in the brain. Mr. Boler noticed his perplexed expression and
      laughed merrily to himself as he started toward the elevator. Before he
      reached it he turned and beckoned to Mr. Winkle to follow him. On the
      third floor they were joined by Dr. Ralston.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is so much better now, Mr. Winkle," explained the genial hotel man,
      "and you are an older man than either the doctor or I, so I thought&mdash;
      It just struck me that she might feel&mdash; That you might like&mdash;
      Oh, damn it, would you like to go up to see her? We are going now. A
      clergyman has called, and if she wants to see him we shall not stay but a
      minute; but as there is no woman about, as she is so alone, I thought
      perhaps she might like to have an older man come with us, for she seems to
      be a very sensitive girl. She has been silent about herself so far; but
      she is better now, and we want to find out what work she can do, and have
      a place ready for her when she is able to get about. Perhaps she will talk
      more freely to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman looked perplexed, but made no reply until they were out
      of the elevator. Then he took Mr. Boler by the arm and said helplessly, "I&mdash;I
      am a bachelor, you know, Johnnie, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" laughed Mr. Boler. "Well, confound it, you don't look it. Anybody
      would take you for the proud father of a large brood. She will think you
      are and it may help her. Come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman entered the darkened room last and sat down silently in
      the deepest shadow. The doctor stepped to the bed and spoke in a low tone.
      A white face on the pillow turned slowly, so that the only band of light
      that reached in from the open door fell full upon it. Mr. Winkle shuddered
      as he saw for the first time the delicate, pallid, hopeless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A priest?" she said feebly, in answer to the doctor. "Oh, no. Why should
      I want to see a priest? You've had your way. You've brought me back to
      battle with a world wherein I only now acknowledged my defeat." Her voice
      trembled with weakness and emotion, but she was looking steadily at the
      doctor with great wide eyes, in which there burnt the intensity of mental
      suffering and a determination to free her mind even at the risk of losing
      the good-will of those who had intended to be kind to her. "A priest! What
      could he do? <i>This</i> life is what I fear. His mission is to deal with
      other worlds&mdash;of which I know already what he does&mdash;and that is
      <i>nothing</i>. Of this life I know, alas! too much. Far more than he. He
      cannot help me, for I could tell him much he <i>cannot</i> know, of
      suffering and fortitude and hope laid low at last, without a refuge even
      in cloistered walls. I know what he would say. His voice would tremble and
      he would offer sympathy and good advice&mdash;and, maybe, alms. These are
      not what I want or need. I am not very old&mdash;just twenty-two&mdash;but
      I have thought and thought until my brain is tired, and what good could it
      do for him to sit beside me here and say in gentle tones that it is very
      sad? No doubt that he would tell me, too, how wicked I have been that I
      should choose to die by my own hand when life had failed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little, and her wan face lit from within was beautiful still
      in spite of its pallor. The doctor murmured something about natural
      sympathy, and Mr. Boler remarked that men who were fortunate would gladly
      help those who were in distress if only they knew in time. She did not
      appear to heed them, but presently went on as though her mind were on the
      clergymen below waiting to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To feel that it is sad is only human; but what is to be done? That is the
      question now. What is to be done for suffering in <i>this</i> world? It is
      life that is hard to bear, not death. Sympathy with the unfortunate is
      good. Kind words and gentle tones as your priest recounts their woes are
      touching. Yes, and when they are drawn to fit the truth would melt a heart
      of stone; but unless action wings the sympathy and dries the tears, the
      object of his tenderness is in no wise bettered&mdash;indeed, is injured.
      Why? Because he lulls to sleep man's conscience and thereby gives relief
      from pangs that otherwise had found an outlet through an open purse. And
      when I say an open purse I do not speak of charity, that double blight
      which kills the self-respect in its recipient and numbs the conscience of
      the 'benevolent' man who grasps the utmost penny <i>here</i> that he may
      give with ostentation <i>there</i>, wounding the many that he may heal the
      few. All this was safe enough, no doubt, while Poverty was ignorant, for
      ignorance is helpless always; but now&mdash;" There was a pause. She
      raised her head a little from the pillow and a frightened look crept into
      her eyes&mdash;"but now the poor are not so ignorant that it will long be
      safe to play at cross purposes with suffering made too intelligent to
      drink in patient faith the bitter draughts of life and wait the crown of
      gold he promises hereafter&mdash;and wears, meanwhile, himself. A <i>little</i>
      joy on earth, they think, will not bedim the lustre of a life that is to
      come&mdash;if such there be. You see I've thought a little in these
      wretched days and months just past." She was silent again for a moment. A
      bitter smile crossed her face and vanished. The doctor offered her a
      powder which she swallowed without a word. John Boler stepped to the table
      and poured out a glass of wine, but when he held it toward her she shook
      her head and closed her eyes a moment. Then she spoke again as if no break
      had checked her thought. "Oh, no; I do not care to see your priest. The
      poor no longer fail to note his willingness to risk the needle's eye with
      camel's back piled high with worldly gain. If he may enter thus, why may
      not they with simpler train and fewer trappings? The poor are asking this
      to-day of prince and priest alike. No answer comes from either. Evasion
      does not satisfy. I ask, but no one answers. The day once was when silence
      passed for wisdom. That day is gone. To-day we are asking why? and why?
      and why? no longer, when? And so the old reply, 'hereafter,' does not fit
      the query. Why, not when, is what we urge to-day, and your replies must
      change to fit the newer, nearer question. When I say <i>your</i> replies,
      I do not mean you, doctor, nor your friend. You two meant kindly by me.
      Yes, I know. I am not claiming that you are at fault, nor they&mdash;the
      fortunate&mdash;the prince and priest. I understand. Blind nature took her
      course and trod beneath her cruel feet the millions who were born too weak
      to struggle with the foes they found within themselves and in their
      stronger brothers. I know, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay back on the pillow and closed her eyes wearily. Mr. Winkle drew
      near and stood behind the doctor's chair, still keeping in the shadow, but
      watching her pale face with an intensity born of a simple nature easy to
      stir and quick to resolve. The doctor touched her pulse with a light
      finger and gravely nodded his head as he glanced at his watch. Her heavy
      eyelids did not lift but her voice broke the silence again. There was a
      cadence in it that gave a solemn thrill to the three men as they listened,
      the doctor watching with professional interest the effect of the powder he
      had given; the other two waited, expecting they knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ignorance and cruelty of all the past, the superstitious fears, the
      cunning prophecies, the greeds and needs of men, joined hands and marched
      triumphant. They did not halt to ask the fallen what had borne them down.
      They did not silence bugle blasts of joy where new-made graves were thick.
      No silken flag was lowered to warm to life the shivering forms of comrades
      overcome and fallen by the way. The strong marched on and called
      themselves the brave. Sometimes they were. But other times the bravest had
      gone down, plucked at, perchance, by wife or child or friend whose sorrow
      or distress reached out and twined itself about the strong but tender
      heart and held it back until the foot lost step, and in the end the eye
      lost sight of those who only now had kept him company."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her small white hand and pointed as if to a distant
      battlefield, but her eyes remained closed. The doctor glanced uneasily at
      his watch and took her other wrist in his fingers again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next battalion trampled him. The priest bent low and whispered 'over
      there, hereafter,' and slipped the treasure of the fallen hero beneath his
      ample robe to swell the coffers of the church, since dead men need no
      treasures."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was infinitely sad but she laughed a little and opened her eyes.
      They fixed themselves upon the silvered head of Mr. Winkle standing behind
      the doctor's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I shock you. I do not mean to, but I have thought and thought
      these last few wretched months, and looking at the battlefields of life
      backward through all the ages, I thought I saw at night, in camp, the
      priest and conqueror meet beside the campfire and council for the next
      day's march. I thought I heard the monarch say, 'I go before and cleave my
      way. You follow me and gather up two things&mdash;the spoils I miss and
      all the arrows of awakened scorn and wrath embedded in the breasts of
      those of our own ranks who fall or are borne down, lest they arise and
      overtake us while we sleep and venge themselves on us. Tell them to wait.
      Their time will come. Tell them <i>I</i> clear the way for them, and <i>you</i>
      forgive a hatred which you see is growing up within their wicked breasts.
      Quiet, soothe, and shame them into peace. Assure them that <i>hereafter</i>
      they, not we, shall have the better part. Gain time. Lay blame to me if
      need be; but always counsel patience, waiting, acquiescence, peace,
      submission to the will of God&mdash;<i>your will and mine</i>. Your task
      is easy. No danger lies therein. I take the risk and share with you the
      glory and the gain.' I heard the priest disclaim all greed of gain and go
      to do his part as loyal subject and as holy man. I saw all this and more
      before I took the last resolve you balked. You meant it kindly, doctor,
      yes, I know, but I am very tired and what is there ahead for me, or such
      as I, on battlefields like these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one ventured a reply. She closed her eyes and waited. The doctor took
      another powder from his case and held it above her lips. She smiled and
      swallowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take our powders very docilely," she said, with a bitter little laugh
      as the wine-glass left her hand and Mr. Boler's finger touched her own. He
      noticed that hers was very cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They used to make us sleep in the good old days of priest and monarch,
      but our nerves are wrong just now. Our powders only make us think the more
      and have strange visions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ralston glanced at Mr. Boler and nodded his head mysteriously. The
      powder was beginning to work, he thought, for she had reverted to the old
      vision, and talked as if she were in a dream. "That way it was, another
      way it is, and still another will be," she was saying. "To-day the honest
      poor, the hampered weak, are defeated, dazed, and some of us are hopeless.
      Others there are who cling to hope and life and brood on vengeance. That
      is your danger, gentlemen, for days that are to come. You will have to
      change your powders. The old prescriptions do not make us sleep. We think,
      and think, and think. We strain our nerves and break our hearts, for what?
      A life as cold and colorless and sad as death itself&mdash;to some of us
      far sadder&mdash;and yet you will not even let us die. Again we ask you,
      why? There is no place on earth for such as we, unless we will be
      criminals. That is the hinge whereon the future turns. How many will
      prefer the crime to want? What dangers lie behind the door that now is
      swinging open? Intelligence has taught us scorn for such a grovelling lot,
      has multiplied our needs, and turned the knife of suffering in quivering
      wounds no longer deadened by the anaesthetics of ignorant content with
      life or superstitious fear of death. The door is swinging on the hinge.
      The future has to face creatures the past has made like demons. Some, like
      myself, behind the door, who do not love mere life, will turn the
      sharpened dagger on themselves. But there are others&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sank. The three men thought that she had fallen asleep at last.
      The doctor drew a long satisfied breath and consulted his watch for the
      fourth time, making a mental note for future use in giving the drug whose
      action he was watching. He started and frowned, therefore, when her voice
      broke the silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Others there are, in spite of pain and anguish, in spite of woe and fear,
      who cling to life&mdash;who read in eyes they worship the pangs of hunger,
      cold, and mental agony. Where will their vengeance go? Who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her great eyes and looked first at one and then at another, and
      repeated, "Who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was no reply. After a long pause Mr. Winkle said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a place in life for girls like you. I shall charge myself with
      it. You shall find work and joy yet, my child. Now go to sleep. Be quiet.
      We have let you talk too long. Stop thinking sadly now. You think too
      much. You <i>think</i> too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes quickly and there was a tightening of the lips that
      left them paler than before. Then a tear rolled slowly down her temple.
      Before it reached the pillow the doctor bent forward and dried it softly
      with his silk handkerchief. She opened her eyes wide at the touch. "'Be
      quiet?'" she repeated, "'stop thinking?' Oh, yes; <i>I</i> will be quiet,
      but the rest, the others? Those with whom you do not charge yourself, who
      find no work, no joy? Will <i>they</i> be quiet, will they stop thinking?
      Oh, yes; I can be quiet, very quiet, but the rest, the rest? The others
      who think too much&mdash;<i>all, all?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wild look in her dry eyes. The doctor touched her wrist again
      and said softly to the men beside him, "It is working now. She will sleep.
      But the shock of all her trouble has left her mind unhinged, poor child.
      'The rest? the others?' <i>We</i> cannot care for all the countless poor.
      Her brain is surely touched, poor child, poor child. How can we tell
      whether the others will stop thinking, or how, or when? Her mind was
      wandering, and now she sleeps, poor child. Come out. She is best alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      They closed the door gently behind them and stood a moment in awkward
      silence outside, each one afraid to speak and yet ashamed of his own
      tender helplessness. At last Mr. Winkle looking steadily in the crown of
      his hat, said huskily, "By gad, boys, there is something rotten in the
      state of Denmark." They all three laughed with an effort, but kept their
      eyes averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a rat in the wainscoting of the storeroom," said John Boler, with a
      desperate attempt to regain his old manner and tone, "and I've got to go
      and look after it or there'll be the devil to pay with the Boler House."
      And he ran down the stairs three steps at a time heartily ashamed of his
      own remark, but determined not to allow the tears to show themselves
      either in his eyes or voice, and feeling that his only safety was in
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Winkle had not stood silently behind the doctor's chair all that
      time for nothing, and if his nature was somewhat light, and if he had
      taken life so far as something of a jest, he was by no means without a
      heart. He did not now trouble himself very greatly about the tangled
      problems of existence, but he felt quite equal to dealing with any given
      case effectively and on short notice. With systems he was helpless, with
      individuals he could deal promptly. Therefore he, in common with the
      doctor and Mr. Boler, and, indeed, with most of us, occupied himself with
      the girl he saw suffering and in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had cried out, "But the rest, the others, what of them?" he had
      said nothing, because he had nothing to say. He was vaguely aware that
      when the smallpox broke out on one of Dr. Ralston's patients that astute
      practitioner did not essay to treat each individual pustule separately as
      the whole of the disease and so devote his entire skill and mind to each
      in turn until it was cured. But then he could not undertake to cure the
      whole human race of its various social ailments any more than Dr. Ralston
      could hope to look after all of its physical pains. So Mr. Winkle took
      this one little social pustule upstairs as his particular charge, and in
      his own peculiar way went about securing better conditions for her,
      leaving the "others who think too much" to somebody else, or to fate, as
      the case might be. Therefore, when Mr. Winkle reached the street door and
      met an officer of the law who had come prepared to learn the whereabouts
      of the would-be suicide or else take Mr. John Boler and Dr. Ralston into
      custody, the old gentleman made up his mind to begin his part in the
      future proceedings without further delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unknown to Mr. Winkle himself, literature had lost a great novelist when
      he had gone into the mercantile business, and the surprises which he now
      sprang upon the policeman were no less astonishing and interesting to
      himself than they were to that astute guardian of the public morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to know where she is, do you? Well, don't worry Johnnie Boler any
      more. They've already got him so his mind is a little affected. I'll tell
      you all about that girl. Her name is Estelle Morris. She worked for me for
      nine years as a nursery governess. Last month my youngest child died, and
      it upset Estelle so that she has been out of her head ever since. I
      thought if I'd bring her to the city maybe she might get over it, but she
      didn't, and the doctor gave her some stuff and she took a double dose by
      mistake, and all the row came from that and the long tongues of the
      servants, pieced out by the long pencils of the reporters. See!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" exclaimed the officer. "Where is she now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle had not thought of that, and he did not know exactly what to
      say; but he agreed to produce her in court on the following day if so
      ordered, and there the matter dropped for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening there appeared in a paper this "want:" "A good-looking young
      woman who is willing to lie like a pirate for the space of one hour for
      the sum of $50. May have to go to court." The number of handsome girls who
      were anxious to lend the activity of their tongues for the purpose named
      and the amount stipulated was quite wonderful. One particularly bright
      young miss remarked that she had been in training for just that position
      for years. She was confidential correspondent for a broker. Mr. Winkle
      accepted her on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said he, "look solemn and sad. That is right. You do it first rate.
      Whatever I tell about you you are to stick to. Understand that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly. Years of practice," she responded, with entire simplicity and
      without a suspicion of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name is Estelle Morris, and you have been the governess of my
      children for nine years. How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nineteen," said Estelle Morris demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious, girl, what could you teach at ten years of age? You've got
      to be older. Take the curl out of your hair in front and put on a bonnet
      with strings. I heard my niece say that made her look ten years older.
      Mind you, you are not a day under twenty-six. Not a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Estelle Morris thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to look sick, too, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can fix <i>that</i> easy enough. I'll&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then fix it and come back here at exactly two o'clock this
      afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour, Mr. Winkle met Miss Estelle Morris and took her
      with great dignity and care to the Boler House, where he was joined by
      another gentleman&mdash;an officer of the law&mdash;and the three started
      out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The examination was strictly private in deference to the wishes of the
      parties first implicated, John Boler and Dr. Ralston, and because it is
      now believed that the girl is more sinned against than sinning," wrote the
      reporter for the morning rival of the <i>Screamer</i>. "It is the object
      of justice to help the erring to start anew in life wherever that line of
      action is consonant with the stern necessities of the blind goddess.
      Neither of the male accomplices appeared in the case, but Mr. Silas Winkle&mdash;whose
      name has figured somewhat conspicuously in the matter&mdash;produced the
      principal, who, it must be confessed, is pretty enough to account for all
      the chivalry which has been displayed in her behalf. She confessed to
      twenty-six years of single wretchedness, although she could easily pass
      for a year or two younger. It would appear that she had lived in Mr.
      Winkle's family for nine years as governess to his children and came to
      the city with him about two weeks ago. The justice accepted this
      explanation of the relations existing between them, and that there was no
      attempt at suicide at all, but only an accidental overdose of a remedy
      prescribed by Dr. Ralston, which explained satisfactorily the doctor's
      connection with the unsavory case, and places him once more in the
      honorable position from which this unfortunate affair so nearly hurled
      him. In short, the justice said in substance, 'not guilty, and don't do it
      any more.' The young woman bowed modestly, and Silas Winkle led her from
      the court-room a sadder, and, let us hope, a wiser woman. Such as she must
      have much to live for. Many a man has braved death for a face less lovely
      than hers. This ends the 'Boler House Mystery,' which, after all, turns
      out to be only a tempest in a teapot, with a respectable father of a
      family and his children's governess for <i>dramatis persono</i> and a
      fresh young reporter on a certain sensational morning contemporary as
      general misinformer of the public as usual." This was headlined, "<i>Exploded&mdash;Another
      Fake by Our Esteemed Contemporary</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night John Boler rubbed his eyes when he read the report. "I thought
      you were a bachelor, Mr. Winkle," said he, "and here you produce in court
      a governess&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," said Mr. Winkle, laughing, and then he showed his "want"
      advertisement. "That is the whole case, Johnnie, my boy, but it is all
      over now. Don't you worry; it might go to your head again. You saved the
      girl and I saved you, and it only cost me $50. I'd pay that any time to
      get ahead of the <i>Screamer</i>, and I rather think I salted that
      enterprising sheet down this time, don't you? But what is to become of
      that girl?" added he, without waiting for a reply to his first question.
      "You've taken the liberty to save her life, which she had decided she did
      not want under existing circumstances. Has she simply got to go over the
      same thing again? I told her that I'd look after her, but I don't see how
      in thunder I'm going to do it. She won't take money from me and <i>I've</i>
      got nothing for her to do. Is there nothing ahead of her but a coffin or a
      police court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For this individual girl, yes. Dr. Ralston has already secured work for
      her; but for all the thou-sands of her kind&mdash;" John Boler's voice
      trembled a little and he stopped speaking to hide it. He in common with
      most men was heartily ashamed of his better nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For all the thousands of her kind," broke in Mr. Winkle, "there are just
      exactly three roads open&mdash;starvation, suicide, or shame, with the
      courts, the legislature, and the newspapers on the side of the latter. I
      just tell you, Johnnie, it makes my blood boil. I&mdash;I don't see any
      way out of it&mdash;none at all. That is the worst of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said Mr. Boler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You do!</i>" exclaimed Mr. Winkle excitedly, and then looked hard at
      his old friend's son to see if he had gone crazy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do. Those same newspapers you are so down on will do it. They're
      bound to. The boys go wrong sometimes, as they did in this case; but that
      only makes sensible people indignant, and, after all, it called attention
      to the law that makes such things possible. <i>More light on the laws</i>.
      That's the first thing we want, and no matter which side of a question the
      papers take, we are bound to get that in the long run. Silence is the
      worst danger. We get pretty mad at the boys if they write what we don't
      like, but that isn't half so dangerous as if they didn't write at all.
      See?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle turned slowly away and shook his head as he murmured to
      himself: "Who would have believed that old John Boler would have been the
      father of a lunatic? Dear me, dear me. I'm going back to Meadville before
      I get touched in the head myself." And he started to his room to pack his
      valise. John Boler followed him to the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't blame you for feeling pretty mad about all the stuff they put in
      the <i>Screamer</i> about you; but&mdash;oh, the boys <i>mean</i> all
      right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So does the devil," broke in the old man. But Mr. Boler gave no evidence
      of noticing the interruption nor of observing the irascibility of his
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is with the system," he went on, entering the elevator after
      Mr. Winkle. "Why, just look at it, man. What I say or do, if it is of a
      public nature, I'm responsible for <i>to</i> the public. What you write
      you put your name to; but it's a pretty big temptation to a young fellow
      who knows he has got the swing in a newspaper and doesn't have to sign his
      name to what he says, to make an effort to 'scoop' his rivals at whatever
      cost. The boys don't mean any harm, but irresponsible power is a mighty
      dangerous weapon to handle. Not many older men can be trusted to use it
      wisely. Then why should we expect it of those young fellows who don't know
      yet any of the deeper meanings of life? Great Scott, man! <i>I</i> think
      they do pretty well under the circumstances. I'm afraid I'd do worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Winkle stroked his chin reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, no doubt," he said abstractedly, as they stepped out of the
      elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Boler looked at him for a brief space of time to see if he had
      intended the thrust and then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That girl's life or death just meant an item to the boys, and it didn't
      mean much more to you or me until&mdash;until we stood and heard her talk
      and saw her suffer, and were made personally uncomfortable by it. Yet we
      are old enough to know all about it for her and others. We <i>do</i> know
      it, and go right along as if we didn't. We are a pretty bad lot, don't you
      think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silas Winkle unlocked his door before he spoke. Then he turned to his old
      friend's son and shook his hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," he said, looking at him steadily. "Good-bye, Johnnie. I see it
      only comes on you at odd spells. Come up to Meadville for a while and I
      think you will get over it altogether. Your father was the clearest-headed
      man I ever saw and you seem to have lucid intervals. Those last remarks of
      yours were worthy of your father, my boy," and the old man patted him
      softly on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Boler whistled all the way downstairs. Then he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if old Winkle really does think I am off my base," said he, as
      he took down his hat. "I suppose we are all more or less crazy. He thinks
      I am and I know he is. It is a crazy world. Only lunatics could plan or
      conduct it on its present lines." And he laughed again and then sighed and
      passed out into the human stream on Broadway.

      "Don't be so hard on yourself, Nellie. I am sure it can be no great wrong
      you have done. Girls like you are too apt to be morbid. No doubt we all do
      it, whatever it is. I'm sure I shall not blame you when you tell me.
      Perhaps I shall say you are quite right&mdash;that is, if there is any
      right and wrong to it, and provided I know which is which, after I hear
      the whole story&mdash;as most likely I shall not. Right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And here the elder woman smiled a little satirically, and looked out of
      the window with a far-away gaze, as if she were retravelling through vast
      spaces of time and experience far beyond anything her friend could
      comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening shadows had gathered, and cast, as they will, a spell of
      gravity and exchange of confidences over the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the older woman began speaking again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Nell, I was always a little surprised that Lord Byron, of
      all people, should have put it that way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I know the right, and I approve it too;
     Condemn the wrong&mdash;and yet the wrong pursue.
</pre>
    <p>
      "<i>The</i> right '&mdash;why, it is like a woman to say that. As if there
      were but one 'right,' and it were dressed in purple and fine linen, and
      seated on a throne in sight of the assembled multitude! '<i>The right.</i>'
      indeed! Yes, it sounds like a woman&mdash;and a very young woman at that,
      Nellie."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked with large, troubled, passionate eyes at her friend, and
      then broke out into hot, indignant words&mdash;words that would have
      offended many a woman; but Florence Campbell only laughed, a light, queer
      little peal; tipped her chair a trifle farther back, put her daintily
      slippered feet on the satin cushion of the low window-seat, and looked at
      her friend, through the gathering darkness, from under half-closed
      eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently&mdash;this woman was always deliberate in her conversation; long
      silences were a part of her power in interesting and keeping the full
      attention of her listeners&mdash;presently she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you think so. Why shouldn't you? So did I&mdash;once. And do
      you know, Nellie, that sort of sentiment dies hard&mdash;<i>very</i> hard&mdash;in
      a woman. At your age&mdash;" Florence Campbell always spoke as if she were
      very old, although to look at her one would say that she was not
      twenty-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      These delicately formed Dresden-china women often carry their age with
      such an easy grace&mdash;it sits upon them so lightly&mdash;in spite of
      ill-health, mental storms, and moral defeats, that while their more robust
      sisters grow haggard and worn, and hard of feature and tone, under weights
      less terrible and with feelings less intense, they keep their grace and
      gentleness of tone in the teeth of every blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At your age, dear, I would have scorned a woman who talked as I do now;
      and more than that, I would have suspected her, as you do not suspect me,
      of being a very dangerous and not unlikely a very bad person indeed&mdash;simply
      from choice. While you&mdash;you generous little soul&mdash;think that I
      am better than I talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again, and shifted her position as if she were not wholly
      comfortable under the troubled gaze of the great eyes she knew were
      fastened upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I am better than my opinions. I know exactly what you tell
      yourself about me when you are having it out with yourself upstairs. Oh, I
      know! You excuse me for saying this on the theory that it was not
      deliberate&mdash;was an oversight. You account for that by the belief that
      I am not well&mdash;my nerves are shaken. You are perfectly certain that
      <i>I</i> am all right, no matter what I do, or say, or think." She took
      her little friend's soft hand as it twisted nervously a ribbon in her lap,
      and held the back of it against her cheek, as she often did. "But just
      suppose it were some one else&mdash;some other woman, Nellie, you would
      suspect her (no doubt quite unfairly) of all the crimes in the
      statute-books. Oh, I know, I know, child! I did&mdash;at your age&mdash;and,
      sad to relate, <i>I</i> had no Florence Campbell to soften my judgments on
      even one of my sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had grown serious as she talked, and her voice almost trembled. The
      instant she recognized this herself, she laughed again, and said gayly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was a very severe judge&mdash;once&mdash;I do assure you, though
      you may not think so now." She dropped her voice to a tone of mocking
      solemnity, not uncommon with her, and added: "If you won't tell on me,
      I'll make a little confession to you, dear;" and she took both of the
      girl's hands firmly in her own and waited until the promise was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't have it get out for the world, but the fact is, Nell, I
      sometimes strongly suspect that, at your age, I was&mdash;a most
      unmitigated, self-righteous little prig."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie's hands gave a disappointed little jerk: but her friend held them
      firmly, laughed gayly at her discomfiture&mdash;for she recognized fully
      that the girl was attuned to tragedy&mdash;buried her face in them! for an
      instant, and then deliberately kissed in turn each pink little palm&mdash;not
      omitting her own. Then she dropped those of her friend, and leaned back
      against her cushions and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie was puzzled and annoyed. She was on the verge of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Florence, darling," she said presently, "if I did not know you to be the
      best woman in the world, I shouldn't know what to make of your dark hints,
      and of&mdash;and of you. You are always a riddle to me&mdash;a beautiful
      riddle, with a good answer, if only I could guess it. You talk like a
      fiend, sometimes, and you act like&mdash;an angel, always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me up. You can't guess me. Fact is, I haven't got any answer,"
      laughed Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl went steadily on without seeming to hear her: "Do you know,
      there are times when I wonder if it would be possible to be insane and
      vicious, mentally and <i>verbally</i>, as it were, and perfectly sane and
      exaltedly good morally."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Campbell threw herself back on her cushions and laughed gayly,
      albeit a trifle hysterically. "Photograph taken by an experienced artist!"
      she exclaimed. "You've hit me! Oh, you've hit me, Nell." Then sitting
      suddenly bolt-upright, she looked the girl searchingly in the face, and
      said slowly: "Do you know, Nellie, that I am sometimes tempted to tell the
      truth? About myself, I mean&mdash;and to <i>you</i>. Never on any other
      subject, nor to anybody else, of course," she added dryly, in comedy
      tones, strangely contrasting with the almost tragic accents as she went
      on. "But I can't. '<i>The</i> truth!' Why, it is like <i>the</i> right;
      I'm sure I don't know what it is; and it has been so long&mdash;oh, so
      cruelly long&mdash;since I told it, by word or action, that I have lost
      its very likeness from my mind. I have told lies and acted lies so long&mdash;"
      Her friend's eyes grew indignant and she began to protest, but Florence
      ran on: "I have evaded facts&mdash;not only to others, but to myself,
      until&mdash;until I'd have to swear out a search-warrant and have it
      served on my mental belongings to find out myself what I <i>do</i> think
      or feel or want on any given subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the woman to use this flippant method of
      expression, even in her most intense moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I change so, Nell; sometimes suddenly&mdash;all in a flash."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Then she began again, quite seriously:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a theory, you know, that we inherit traits and conditions from
      our remote ancestors as well as from our immediate ones. I sometimes fancy
      that they descend to some people with a Time Lock attachment. A child is
      born"&mdash;she held out her hands as if a baby lay on them&mdash;"he is
      like his mother, we will say, gentle, sweet, kind, truthful, for years&mdash;let
      us say seven. Suddenly the Time Lock turns, and the traits of his father
      (modified, of course, by the acquired habits of seven years) show
      themselves strongly&mdash;take possession, in fact. Another seven years,
      and the priggishness of a great-uncle, the stinginess of an aunt, or the
      dullness, in books, of a rural grandfather. Then, in keeping with the next
      two turns of the Lock, he falls in love with every new face he sees,
      marries early and indulges himself recklessly in a large family. He is an
      exemplary husband and father, as men go, an ideal business man, and a
      general favorite in society."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was running on now as if her words had the whip-hand of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody remarks upon the favorable change since his stupid, priggish
      college days. All this time, through every change, he has been honorable
      and upright in his dealings with his fellows. Suddenly the Time Lock of a
      Thievish Ancestor is turned on; he finds temptation too strong for even
      that greatly under-estimated power&mdash;the force of habit of a lifetime&mdash;and
      the trust funds in his keeping disappear with him to Canada. Everybody is
      surprised, shocked, pained&mdash;and he, no doubt, more so than any one
      else. Emotional insanity is offered as a possible explanation by the
      charitable; longheaded, calculating, intentional rascality, by the severe
      or self-righteous. And he? Well, he is wholly unable to account for it at
      all. He <i>knows</i> that he had not lived all these years as a conscious,
      self-controlled thief. He <i>knows</i> that the temptations of his past
      life had never before taken that particular form. He <i>knows</i> that the
      impulse was sudden, blinding, overwhelming; but he does not know why and
      how. It was like an awful dream. He seemed to be powerless to overcome it.
      The Time Lock had turned without his knowledge, and in spite of himself.
      The unknown, unheard-of Thievish Ancestor took possession, as it were,
      through force of superior strength and ability&mdash;and then it was his
      hour. The hereditary shadow on the dial had come around to him. The
      great-uncle's hour was past. <i>He</i>, no doubt, was 'turned on' to some
      other dazed automaton&mdash;in Maine or Texas&mdash;who had fallen heir to
      a drop too much of his blood, and she, poor thing, if it happened to be a
      girl this time, forthwith proceeded to fall in love with her friend's
      husband&mdash;seeing he was the only man at hand at the time; while the
      Thievish Ancestor left&mdash;in shame and contrition&mdash;a small but
      light-fingered boy in Georgia, to keep his engagement with our
      respectable, highly honored, and heretofore highly honorable man of
      affairs in Wall street. The Time Lock of heredity had been set for this
      hour, and the machinery of circumstances oiled the wheels and silently
      moved the dial." There was absolute silence when Florence Camp-bell's
      voice ceased. The heavy curtains made the shadows in the struggling
      moonlight deep and solemn. Two great eyes looked out into the darkness and
      a shudder passed over her frame. She thought her little friend had fallen
      asleep, she lay so still and quiet on the rug at her feet. Florence
      sighed, and thought how quickly youth forgot its troubles and how lightly
      Care sat on her throne. Then suddenly a passionate sobbing broke the
      silence, and two arms, covered with lace and jewels, flung themselves
      around the older woman's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O my God! Florence; O my God! is there no way to stop the wheels? Must
      they go blindly on? Can we <i>never</i> know who or what we shall be
      to-morrow? It is awful, Florence, awful; and&mdash;it&mdash;is <i>true!</i>
      O God! it is <i>true!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Campbell had been very serious when she stopped her little
      harangue. There had been a quality in her voice which, while it was not
      wholly new to her friend, <i>would</i> have been unknown to many who
      thought they knew her well. To them she was a beautiful, fashionable,
      rather light woman, with a gay nature, who either did not know, or did not
      care to investigate too closely, the career of her husband, to whom she
      was devotedly attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been quite serious, I say, when she stopped her little
      philosophical speculation; but she was greatly surprised at the storm she
      had raised in the breast of her little friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence bent down quickly, and putting her arms about the girl tried to
      raise her up; but she only sobbed the harder, and clung to her friend's
      knees as a desperate, frightened creature might cling to its only refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Nellie, little kitten," said the older woman, using a term of
      endearment common with her in talking with the girl&mdash;"why, Nellie,
      little kitten, what in the world is the matter? Did I scare the life out
      of you with my Time Locks and my gruesome ancestors?" and she tried to
      laugh a little; but the sound of her voice was not altogether pleasant to
      the ear. "I'll ring for a light. I had no business to talk such stuff to
      you when you were blue and in the dark too. I guess, Nell, that the Time
      Lock of <i>my</i> remote ancestor, who was a fool, must have been turned
      on me shortly after sundown to-day, don't you think?" And this time her
      laugh lacked the note of bitterness it had held before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran on, still caressing the weeping girl at her feet:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, undoubtedly, my Remote Ancestor&mdash;the fool&mdash;has now moved
      in. Do you think you can stand seven years of him, kitten, if you live
      with me that long? But you won't. You'll go and marry some horrid man, and
      I shall be so jealous that my hair will curl at sight of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl would not laugh. She refused to be cheered, nor would she
      have a light. She raised herself until her head rested on her friend's
      bosom, and clung to her, sobbing as if her heart would break. Florence
      stroked her hair and sat silent for a while, wondering just what had so
      shaken the child. She knew full well that it was <i>not</i> what she had
      hinted of the darkness and her gruesome story. Presently Nellie drew her
      friend's face down, and whispered between her sobs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, I must have had some dreadful ancestor, a wicked&mdash;<i>wicked</i>
      woman. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Campbell shrieked with laughter. She felt relieved of&mdash;she
      did not know what. She had blamed herself for even unconsciously touching
      the secret spring of sorrow in the girl's heart. It was a strange sight,
      the two women clinging to each other, the one sobbing, the other laughing,
      each trying in vain to check the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Nellie said, still almost in a whisper: "But, Florence, you do not
      know. You do not understand. You are too good to know. It is you who will
      scorn and hate me when I tell you. O Florence, Florence, I can never <i>dare</i>
      to tell you!" Her friend, still laughing, made little ejaculations of
      satirical import as the girl grew more and more hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O thou wicked wretch!" laughed she. "No doubt you've killed your man, as
      they say out West. Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear! Nell, this is really quite
      delicious! Did it step on a bug? Or was it a great big spider? And does it
      think it ought to be hanged for the crime? A peal of laughter from the
      one, a shudder from the other, was the only reply to these efforts to
      break the force of the girl's self-reproach. Florence clinched her small
      fist in mock heroics and began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your crimes have found you out! And mine&mdash;<i>mine</i>&mdash;has been
      the avenging hand! Really, this is too good, kitten. I shall tell, let me
      see&mdash;I shall tell&mdash;<i>Tom!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was on her feet in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that! <i>not that</i>, Florence! Anything but that! I will tell you
      myself first&mdash;<i>he</i> shall not?" Florence grew suddenly silent and
      grave. The girl slipped down at her knees again, and clasping her hand,
      went hoarsely on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Florence, darling, I did not mean to wrong you! Truly, truly, I did not&mdash;and
      I do not believe <i>he</i> did&mdash;not at&mdash;first. We&mdash;oh, it
      was&mdash;" she sank on the floor, at the feet of her astonished friend,
      and with upstretched arms in the darkness whispered: "Florence, Florence&mdash;O
      my God! I <i>cannot</i> tell you! I must go away! <i>I must go away!</i>"
      The older woman did not touch the outstretched hands and they sank to the
      floor, and on them rested a tear-stained, wretched face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Tom Campbell entered the room. To eyes unaccustomed to the
      darkness nothing was visible. He did not see his wife, who arose as he
      entered, and stood with bated breath over the form of the girl on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" he muttered, "this room is as dark as Egypt, and then some&mdash;Wonder
      where Florence is. Those damned servants ought to be shot! Whole house
      like a confounded coal-pit! Didn't expect me for hours yet, I suppose!
      That's no reason for living like a lot of damned bats! 'Fraid of
      musquitoes, I suppose. Where are those matches? <i>Florence!</i> She's
      evidently gone out&mdash;or to bed. Wonder where her little 'kitten' is?
      Umm&mdash;wonder how much longer Florence means to keep her here? Don't
      see how the thing's going to go on much longer this way, with a girl with
      a conscience like that. Perfectly abnormal! Perfectly ridiculous! Umm&mdash;no
      more tact than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie moaned aloud. Florence had held her breath, hoping he would go. He
      had almost reached the door leading to the hall, after his vain search for
      matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello! what was that?" said Campbell, turning again into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife knew that escape was not now possible. "Nothing, Tom," she said,
      in a voice that trembled a little. "Go upstairs. I will come up soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, hello, Florence, that you? What are you sitting here in the dark
      for, all alone? Why didn't you speak to me when I came in? What did you
      let me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie sat up, and in doing so overturned a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness. He saw the two women
      outlined before him, and he saw that Nellie had been on the floor, and
      that his wife stood over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he demanded. "What's up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He came toward them. Nellie sprang to her feet, with flashing eyes and
      outstretched, imploring hands to wave him back. She was about to rush into
      a painful explanation. Florence stepped toward her, put both arms about
      her, and drew her onto the cushioned window-seat at their side. She knew
      she must cover the girl's agitation from her husband, and somehow gain
      time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, dear," she said softly. "Sit down here by me. You have been
      asleep. He frightened you coming in so suddenly. You have been dreaming;
      you talked in your sleep&mdash;but it was all nonsense&mdash;about an
      ancestor, whom you blamed very bitterly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl began to speak impulsively, but Florence checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. You told me. It was all the greatest stuff. But the part
      that was true&mdash;I doubt if she was to blame. I think, from all I know
      of&mdash;of her, and of the gentleman you mentioned, the one she&mdash;seemed
      to care for&mdash;that&mdash;oh, no, kitten! I am <i>sure she</i> was not
      to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie was trembling violently, clinging to her friend in shame and
      remorse. Tom stood perfectly quiet in the deeper darkness, back from the
      window, with a smile on his cheerful face and a puzzled light in his
      handsome eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go upstairs, Tom," said Florence again, this time in a steadier tone.
      "Nellie's head aches; you waked her up too suddenly. We don't want more
      light&mdash;do we, Nellie? Not just now. We have quite light enough for
      the present. I assure you we are better off just now in the dark. You
      would think so yourself if you could see us as we see ourselves. We are
      quite battered and out at elbow, I assure you, and not at all fit for
      fastidious masculine eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pulling herself up well. "To-morrow we will spruce up our bangs,
      put on fresh gowns, and not know ourselves for the wretches we are
      tonight. Until then, Sir Knight, no masculine eye shall rest upon our
      dilapidation. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Campbell had seen his wife in this mood before. He went.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way upstairs he wondered what had happened. "Never could make
      women out anyway," he muttered; "least of all, Florence. Women are a queer
      lot. More you live with 'em, more you don't know what they'll do next.
      Wonder what in thunder's up. 'Kitten' never said a word; but I'm damned if
      I did't hear her groan! Guess the little goose feels kind of&mdash;queer&mdash;with
      me and the old lady both present. Wonder&mdash;whew!&mdash;wonder how much
      I said aloud, and how much they heard when I first went in! Confounded
      habit, talking aloud to myself! Got to stop it, old boy; must be done&mdash;get
      you into trouble yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned off the gas, and was sleeping as peacefully as an infant
      before the two women below stairs had parted for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom left the room, Nellie began to sob again, and Florence stroked
      her hair with her icy hands and waited for the girl to speak&mdash;or grow
      calm. And for herself&mdash;she hardly knew what she waited for in
      herself; but she felt that she needed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence she said, quite gently; "Nellie, little girl, we will
      go upstairs now; you will go to bed. If you ever feel like it, after you
      take time to think it over, and your nerves are quiet&mdash;if you ever
      feel like it, you may tell just what trick your troublesome ancestor has
      tried to play you; but I want to say now, dear, don't feel that you <i>must</i>
      tell me, nor that I do not know perfectly well that my little kitten is
      all right, ancestors or no ancestors, and that we, together can somehow
      find the combination to that Time Lock that so distresses you, and turn it
      off again. Meantime, little girl <i>no one</i> shall harm you. You shall
      be let alone; you are all right! Be <i>sure</i> of that. I am. Now,
      good-night;" and she kissed the still sobbing girl on the forehead and
      hands, in spite, of her protests and self-accusations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Nellie sank on her knees again, and grasped Florence's dress as
      she had turned to go:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Florence! O Florence! are you human? How <i>can</i> you? You are not
      like other women! O my God! if I could only be like you; but you frighten
      me! You are so calm. How cold your hands are! oh&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they? I did not notice. Oh well, no matter; it is an old trick of
      theirs, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Campbell's voice was very steady now. Her words were slow and
      deliberate&mdash;they sounded as if she was very tired; and her step, as
      she climbed the stairs, had lost its spring and lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Nellie's breakfast was carried to her room, with a
      message from Florence not to get up until she came to her at their usual
      hour for reading together.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon, as the girl lay thinking for the hundredth time that she must
      get up and face life again&mdash;that she must somehow stop this blinding
      headache, and go away&mdash;that she must die&mdash;Florence swept into
      the room, trailing her soft, long gown behind her, and gently closed the
      door. She had put on a gay pink tea-gown, with masses of white lace and
      smart little bows in unexpected places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel better, dear?" she asked, gayly. "Griggs told me your head ached,
      and that you had not slept well. I confess I did not either&mdash;not
      very. Tom and I talked rather late; you know he sails for Liverpool at
      noon. Sure enough, you didn't know. Well, no matter. The vessel is just
      about sailing now. Yes, it is <i>rather</i> sudden. We talked so much of
      it last night that it seems quite an old story to me to-day, though. You
      know he was to go in two weeks, anyway. It seemed best to go earlier, so I
      helped him pack, and saw him to the steamer two hours ago. You know a man
      doesn't have to take anything but a tooth-brush and a smoking-cap. We
      thought it would be best for his health to go at once. Tom has not seemed
      quite himself of late." She did not look at her friend as she talked and
      her white face was turned from the light. She talked so fast, it seemed as
      if she had rehearsed and was repeating a part with a desire to have it
      over as soon as might be. "His Travelling Ancestor, the one who wants
      change&mdash;change&mdash;change in all things, has had hold of him of
      late. I'm sure you have noticed how restless he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sat up and listened with wide eyes and flushed cheeks. She had
      known many unexpected and unexplained things to be done in the house of
      this friend, who had given her a home and a warm welcome a year before,
      when she had left school, an orphan and homeless. But this sudden
      departure she had not heard even mentioned before. She thought she
      understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Florence! Florence!" she cried, passionately. "It is <i>my</i> fault! I
      have separated you! I have brought sorrow to you! You, who are so good, <i>so
      good;</i> and I&mdash;oh, how <i>can</i> you be so kind to me? <i>Hate</i>
      me! <i>Hate me!</i> Thrust me from your house, and tell the world I tried
      to steal your husband! Tell that I am vile and wicked! Tell&mdash;and now
      I have sent him away from you, who love him&mdash;whom he loves! Why do
      you not blame me? Why do you never blame anyone? Why&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; the girl sobbed bitterly, while the older woman seemed
      afraid to trust her voice. After a while in a tired, solemn tone, Nellie
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you can believe a word I say, Florence? Is there any use for
      me to tell you the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her friend nodded slowly, looking her steadily in the eyes. Her lips were
      tightly drawn together, and her hands were cold and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Florence, I will tell you, truly&mdash;truly&mdash;truly, as I hope
      for&mdash;" She was going to say "your forgiveness," but it seemed too
      cruel to ask for that just now. "I did not understand, not at first,
      either him or myself. I thought he was like you"&mdash;she felt Florence
      shudder&mdash;"and loved me, as he said, as you did. I was so glad and
      proud, until&mdash;until&mdash;O Florence! how can I tell you that I let
      him <i>beg</i> me to go away with him! After I understood what he meant,
      my heart <i>did</i> leap, even in its utter self-abasement and
      wretchedness. I let him beg me twice, and kiss me, <i>after</i> I
      understood! It must have been my fault; he said it was"&mdash;Florence
      took her friend's hand in hers&mdash;"and he said that no one else had
      ever taken his thoughts away from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl thought she saw the drawn lips before her curl; but she must free
      her whole heart now, and lay bare her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said that he had always been true to you, Florence, even in thought,
      until I&mdash;O Florence! I must be worse than anyone one earth. I&mdash;he
      said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Campbell sprang to her feet. "Yes, I know, I know!" she
      exclaimed, breathlessly, "and you <i>believed</i> him! Poor little fool!
      Women do. Sometimes a second time, but not a third time, dear&mdash;not a
      third time! Do not blame yourself any more." She stopped, then hurried on
      as one will do when danger threatens from within. "If it had not been you,
      it would, it might&mdash;my God! it might have been worse! Some poor girl&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped again as if choking. The two women looked at each other; the
      younger one gave a long, shuddering moan, and buried her face in her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Florence said slowly: "All ancestors were not thieves. Some were
      simply fickle, and light, and faithless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie raised a face full of passionate suffering: "Florence! Florence!
      how can you excuse either of us? How <i>can&mdash;</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with a great sob, Florence Campbell threw herself into the
      girl's outstretched arms, and with a wail of utter desolation cried:
      "Hush, Nellie, hush! Never speak of it again, never! Only <i>love</i> me,
      <i>love me&mdash;love me!</i> I need it so! And <i>no</i> one&mdash;no one
      in all the world has ever loved me truly!" It was the only time Nellie
      ever saw Florence Campbell lose her self-control.

    <h2>
      FLORENCE CAMPBELL'S FATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>"'Tis the good reader that makes the good book; a good head cannot read
      amiss; in every book he finds passages which seem confidences or asides
      hidden from all else and unmistakably meant for his ear....</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Every man has a history worth knowing, if he could tell it, or if we
      could draw it from him."</i>&mdash;Ralph Waldo Emerson.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting in my office, with my head in my hands, and with both elbows
      resting on my desk. I was tired in every nerve of my body; more than that,
      I was greatly puzzled over the strange conduct of my predecessor in the
      college, whose assistant I had been, and whose place I was appointed to
      fill during the unexpired term for which he had been elected lecturer on
      anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning he was to introduce me to the class formally as his
      successor, deliver his last lecture, and then retire from active
      connection with anatomical instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything appeared to be perfectly arranged, and, indeed, some of the
      younger men&mdash;under my direction&mdash;had taken special pains to
      provide our outgoing and much admired professor with rather unusual
      facilities for a brilliant close to his career as our instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was feeling particularly pleased with the arrangements, when, after a
      neat little speech on his part, commendatory of me, and when we supposed
      him to be about to begin his lecture, he suddenly turned to me and said,
      bluntly: "You will be so good as to take the class to-day. Young
      gentlemen, I bid you good morning," and abruptly took up his hat and left.
      I sat facing an expectant and surprised class of shrewd young fellows, and
      I was quite unprepared to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had intended my first lecture to be a great success. It was ready for
      the following day; but my notes were at home, and my position can,
      therefore, be better imagined than described.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thinking over this and the strange behavior of my generally
      punctilious predecessor, when he entered my office, unannounced, and,
      after the ordinary salutations and apologies for having placed me in so
      undesirable a position in the morning, he told me the following episode
      from his history. I will give it in his own words, omitting, as far as
      possible, all comment made by me at the time, thus endeavoring to leave
      you alone with him and his story, as I was that night. This will better
      enable me to impart the effect to you as it was conveyed to me at the
      time. It greatly interested me then, but the more I think it over, the
      less am I able to decide, in my own mind, all of the psychological
      questions which it aroused then and which it has since called up. This is
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0018" id="link2H_4_0018">

    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am, as you know, not a young man, and in the practice of my profession,
      which has extended over a period of nearly thirty years, I have learned to
      diagnose the cases that come under my care very slowly and by degrees.
      Every year has taught me, what you will undoubtedly learn&mdash;for I have
      great hopes for your future career&mdash;that physical symptoms are often
      the results of mental ailments, and that, while cordials and powders are
      sometimes very useful aids, the first and all-important thing is to
      understand fully the <i>true</i> history of my patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have laid stress upon the word true, simply because while <i>a</i>
      history is easy enough to get, about the most difficult matter in this
      world to secure is <i>the</i> history of one who comes to a physician
      ailing in body or in mind. It is easy enough to treat a broken leg, a
      gunshot wound, or even that ghastliest of physical foes, diphtheria, if it
      is one of these and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if it is a broken leg as to outward sign, and a broken heart as an
      inward fact, then the case is quite another matter, and the treatment
      involves skill of a different kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bullet that tore its way through the body was poisoned with the
      bitterness of disappointment, anxiety, terror, or remorse, something more
      is needed than bandages and beef-tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      If diphtheria was contracted solely from a defective sewage-pipe, it will,
      no doubt, yield to remedies and pure air. But if long years of nervous and
      mental prostration have made ready its reception, the work to be done is
      of a much more serious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I was first called to see Florence Campbell, the message conveyed
      to me threw no light on the case, beyond what the most ordinary observer
      would have detected at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note read thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. H. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Sir: Although I have been in your city for several months, it is the
      first time since I came that I have myself felt that I needed medical
      attention. I have, therefore, not sent you the enclosed note (the history
      of which you no doubt know) until now. If you will read it, it will
      explain that the time has now come when, if you will come to me, I need
      your care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Florence Campbell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parlor 13, F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Ave. Hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The note enclosed was from a physician in Chicago whom I had known
      intimately many years before, but with whom, contrary to the hint given by
      the lady, I had held no communication for a long time past. It said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Doctor: One of my patients is about to visit your city. The
      length of her stay is uncertain, and, as she is often ailing, she has
      asked me to give her a note to one whom I believe to be skilful and to
      possess the qualities which she requires in a physician. In thinking over
      the list of those known to me in New York, I have decided to give her this
      note to you. I need not commend her to you; she will do that for herself.
      You will see at a glance that she is a charming woman, and you will learn
      in five minutes' conversation with her, that she is a brilliant one. She
      is also one of those rare patients to whom you can afford to tell the
      unvarnished truth&mdash;an old hobby of yours, I remember&mdash;and from
      whom you can expect it. She has had no serious illness recently, but is
      rather subject to slight colds and sick headache. I give her sulph. 12.
      She always responds to that in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thomas C. Griswold."
    </p>
    <p>
      I folded the note and laid it on my desk and took up a pen. Then, on
      second thought, I turned to the messenger and said, "Say to Miss Campbell
      that I will call at four o'clock this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had finished the sentence he was gone, and I laid down the pen
      and sat thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      How like Tom Griswold that was&mdash;the old Tom of college days&mdash;to
      write such a note as that and give it to a patient! "Sulph. 12"&mdash;and
      then I laughed outright at his interpretation of my desire for veracious
      relations between patient and practitioner, and re-read his note from end
      to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I read hers again. Neither of them indicated the slightest need of
      haste on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pictured a pretty little blonde&mdash;I knew Tom's taste. He had been
      betrothed to three different girls during the old days, and they had all
      been of that type; small, blue-eyed, Dresden-china sort of girls, who had
      each pouted&mdash;and married someone else in due time, after a
      "misunderstanding" with Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these misunderstandings had been over some roses, I remember. They
      did not "match" her dress in color, and she was wretched. She told him he
      should have known better than to get that shade, when he knew very well
      that she never wore anything that would "go with" it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had naturally felt a little hurt, since he had bought the finest and
      highest-priced roses to be had, and expected ecstatic praise of his taste
      and extravagance. The "misunderstanding" was final, and, after a wretched
      evening and several days of tragic grief, five tinted notes of sorrow,
      reproach, and pride, they each began to flirt with some one else and to
      talk of the inconstancy of the other sex. They vowed, of course, that they
      would never marry anybody on earth, and finally engaged themselves to
      marry some one else, who perhaps, had just passed through a similar
      harrowing experience and was yearning to be consoled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that Tom smoked a great deal during this tragic period, that he
      looked gloomy, wore only black neckties, and allowed a cold to run on
      until it became thoroughly settled and had to be nursed all the rest of
      the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that smoking injured him, and he doubtless had an idea that he
      would end his misery by means of this cold, supplemented by nicotine
      poison. How near he might have approached to success it would be difficult
      to tell, if he had not met my sister Nellie at Christmas-time, and, after
      having told his woes to her, promised her, "as a friend," not to smoke
      again for three days and then to report to her. The report was
      satisfactory, and she then confessed that she had forsworn bonbons for the
      same length of time, as a sort of companionship in sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, impressed Tom as a truly remarkable test of friendship
      and sympathy, and,&mdash;well, what is the use to tell the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      You will know it. It had no new features, so far as I can now recall, and
      I believe that they had been betrothed six months before Nellie met grave
      old Professor Menlo and began the study of Greek roots and mythology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that, perhaps, Tom would have been all right if it had not been
      for the mythology. But Nellie was romantic, and the professor was an
      enthusiast in this branch of knowledge, and so, by and by, Tom, poor
      devil, took to smoking again&mdash;this time it was a pipe&mdash;and local
      papers were filled with notices of the romantic marriage of "Wisdom and
      Beauty," and poor little Nellie wrote a pathetic note to Tom, and sent it
      by me, with frantic directions not to allow him to kill himself because
      she had not understood her own heart; but that she loved him truly&mdash;as
      a friend&mdash;still, and he must come to see her and <i>her</i> professor
      in their new home on the hill. And, dear, dear, what a time I had with
      Tom! It is funny enough now; but even I felt sorry for him then, and
      shielded him from the least unnecessary pain by telling the boys that they
      absolutely must not congratulate me on my sister's marriage, nor mention
      it in any way whatever, when Tom was present, unless they wanted to have
      trouble with me personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to think that Tom married Kittie Johnson before he had fairly finished
      his first year in the hospital service; and had to take her home for his
      father to support! Since then I had seen him from time to time, and heard
      of his large practice, his numerous children, and his elegant home; but he
      never talked of his wife, although I believed him to be perfectly
      satisfied with her. He seemed content, was prosperous beyond expectation,
      and had grown fat and gouty, when I last saw him at a medical convention.
      He attributed his too great flesh and his gout to the climate of his
      Western home, and was constantly threatening to retire from practice, and
      said that he should ultimately come to New York to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, undoubtedly Florence Campbell is a petite blonde, with little white
      teeth and a roseleaf cheek, thought I, and I laughed, and rang for my
      carriage.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not know that I ever entered a more delicately perfumed room&mdash;and
      I am very sensitive to perfumes&mdash;than the one in which Florence
      Campbell sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose from her deep arm-chair as I entered, and, extending her hand,
      grasped mine with a vigor unusual in a woman, even when she is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Dr. Hamilton?" she said, in a clear voice, which told nothing of
      pain, and was wholly free from the usually querulous note struck by women
      who are ill, or who think that they are. "This is Dr. Hamilton? I am very
      glad to see you, doctor. I am Florence Campbell. You received a note from
      your friend, Dr. Griswold, of Chicago, and one telling how I came to send
      it to you&mdash;how I came into possession of it." Direct of speech, clear
      of voice, hand feverish, but firm in grasp, I commented mentally, as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not what I had expected. This is not the limp little blonde that I
      had pictured, on a lounge, in tears, with the light fluffy hair in
      disorder, and a tone of voice which plead for sympathy. This is not the
      figure I had expected to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her back to the light, very erect and well poised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the window," I said. "Does your head ache?" That is always a safe
      question to ask, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. "Oh, I don't know that it does&mdash;not particularly. I
      fancy there is not enough inside of it to ache much. Mere bone and vacuity
      could not do a great deal in that line, could it, doctor?" Then she
      laughed again. She looked me in the eyes, and I fancied she was diagnosing
      <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were deep, large, and brown, or a dark gray; her complexion was
      dark and clear&mdash;almost too transparent; her cheeks were flushed a
      little; and the light in her eyes was unnaturally intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently trying to gain time&mdash;to take my measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is always a rather trying thing to get a new doctor; don't you think
      so?" she asked, with another little laugh. "I always feel so foolish to
      think I have called him to come for so trifling a matter as my ailments
      are. I am never really ill, you know," she said with nervous haste; "but I
      am not very strong, and so I often feel&mdash;rather&mdash;under the
      weather, and I always fancy that a doctor can prevent, or cure it; but I
      suppose he cannot. I shall really not expect a great deal of you, in that
      line, doctor. I cannot expect you to furnish me with robust ancestors, can
      I? Just so you keep me out of bed"&mdash;and here, for the first time, I
      noticed a slight tremor in her voice&mdash;"just keep me so that I can
      read, and&mdash;so that I shall not need to sit alone, and&mdash;think&mdash;I
      shall be quite satisfied&mdash;quite." She had turned her face away, as
      she said the last; but I saw that she was having a hard struggle to keep
      back the tears, notwithstanding the little laugh that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had felt her pulse; it was hardly perceptible, and fluttered rather than
      beat; and I had watched her closely as she spoke; but whenever she came
      near the verge of showing deeper than the surface she broke in with that
      non-committal little laugh, or turned her face, or half closed her great
      eyes, and I was foiled. Her pulse and the faint blue veins told me one
      story; she tried to tell me quite another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you suffering to-day," I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked steadily at me a moment, then lowered her eyes, raised her left
      hand (upon which I remember noticing there was a handsome ring), looked at
      its palm a moment, held her lips tightly closed, and then, with a sudden
      glance at me, again as if on the defensive said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know; I am only a little under the weather; I am weak. I am
      losing my&mdash;grip&mdash;on myself; I am&mdash;losing my grip&mdash;on
      my&mdash;nerves. I cannot afford to do that." The last was said with more
      emotion than she cared to display. So she arose, walked swiftly to the
      dressing-case, took up a lace handkerchief, glanced at herself in the
      mirror, moved a picture (I noticed that it was a likeness of an old
      gentleman, perhaps her father), and returned to a chair which stood in the
      shadow, and then, with a merry little peal of laughter, said: "Well, I
      don't wonder, doctor, that you are unable to diagnose that case. It would
      require a barometer to do that I fancy, from the amount of weather I got
      into it. But really, now, how am <i>I</i> to know what is the matter with
      me? That is for you to say; I am not the doctor. If you tell me it is
      malaria, as all of you do, I shall be perfectly satisfied&mdash;and take
      your powders with the docility of an infant in arms. I suppose it <i>is</i>
      malaria, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to gain time&mdash;to study her a little. I saw that she was, or
      had been really ill; ill, that is, in mind if not in body. I fancied that
      she had succeeded in deceiving Griswold into treating her for some
      physical trouble which she did not have, or, if she had it, only as a
      result of a much graver malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right branch may have been found and nipped off from time time when it
      grew uncomfortably long, but the root, I believed, had not been touched,
      and, I thought, had not been even suspected by her former physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      We of the profession, as you very well know, do not always possess that
      abiding faith in the knowledge and skill of our brethren that we demand
      and expect from outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      We claim our right to guess over after our associates, and not always to
      guess the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believed that Griswold had not fully understood his former patient.
      "Sulph. 12," indeed! Then I smiled, and said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Griswold writes me that in such cases as yours he advises sulph. 12&mdash;that
      it has given relief. Do you call yourself a sulphur patient?" I watched
      her narrowly, and if she did not smile in a satirical way, I was deceived.
      "Are you out of that remedy? and do you want more of it?" I asked with a
      serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply at once. There seemed to be a struggle in her mind as to
      how much she would let me know. Then she looked at me attentively for a
      moment, with a puzzled expression, I thought; an unutterably weary look
      crossed her face. She said, slowly, deliberately: "I have no doubt sulphur
      will do as well as anything else. Oh! yes&mdash;I am decidedly a sulphur
      patient, no doubt I suppose I have taken several pints of that innocent
      remedy in my time. A number of physicians have given it to me from time to
      time. Your friend is not its only devotee. Sulphur and nux&mdash;nux and
      sulphur! I believe they cure anything short of a broken heart, or actual
      imbecility, do they not, doctor?" She laughed, not altogether pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      How far would she go and how far would she let me go, with this
      humbuggery? I looked gravely into her eyes, and said, "Certainly they will
      do all that, and more. They sometimes hold a patient until a doctor can
      decide which of those two interesting complaints is the particular one to
      be treated. In <i>your</i> case I am inclined to suspect&mdash;the&mdash;that
      it is&mdash;<i>not</i> imbecility. I shall therefore begin by asking you
      to be good enough to tell me what it is that affects your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had taken her wrist in my hand, as I began to speak. My finger was on
      her pulse. It gave a great bound, and then beat rapidly; and although her
      face grew a shade paler and her eyes wavered as they tried to look into
      mine, I knew that I had both surprised and impressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself instantly, and made up her mind to hedge still
      further. "If there is anything the matter with my heart, you are the first
      to suspect it. My father, however, died of heart disease, and I have&mdash;always&mdash;hoped
      that I should&mdash;die as suddenly. But I shall not! I shall not! I am so&mdash;wiry&mdash;so
      all-enduring. I recover! I always recover!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said this passionately, and as if it were a grave misfortune&mdash;as
      if she were very old. I pretended to take it humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps at your advanced age your father might have said the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. She saw a loophole, and immediately took it. "Oh, you think I
      am very young, doctor, but I am not. People always think me younger than I
      am&mdash;at first. I look older when you get used to me. I am nearly
      thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised; I had taken her to be about twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In years or in experience?" I said. "Which way do you count your age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up suddenly again and walked to the dressing-case, then to the
      window. In doing so she raised her hand to her eyes. It was the hand with
      the lace handkerchief in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Experience!" she exclaimed; and then, checking herself. "No, people never
      think me so old&mdash;not at first," she said, returning to her chair.
      "But I suppose I am not too old to be cured with sulph. 12, am I?" Then
      she laughed her little nervous, quick laugh, and added: "Dear old Dr.
      Griswold, what faith he must have in 'sulph. 12.' and in his patients. He
      seems to think that they were made for each other, as it were; and&mdash;of
      course, I am not a doctor&mdash;how do I know they were not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Campbell," I said, stepping quickly to her side and surprising her,
      "you do not need sulphur. You need to be relieved of this strain on your
      nerves. Make up your mind to tell me your history to-morrow morning&mdash;to
      tell it all; I do not want some fairy-tale. Until then, take these drops
      to quiet your nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in her eyes. She did not attempt to hide them. They ran
      down her cheeks, and she simply closed the lids and let them flow. I took
      her lace handkerchief and wiped her cheeks. Then I dropped it in her lap,
      placed the phial on her stand, took up my hat, and left.

    <h3>
      But I did not get her story the next day, nor the next, nor the next.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Her tact was perfectly mystifying in its intricacy; her power of evasion
      marvellous, and her study of me amusing. She grew weaker and more languid
      every day; but insisted that she had no pain&mdash;"nothing upon which to
      hang a symptom," she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested that refuge of all puzzled doctors&mdash;a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A change!" she said, wearily. "A change! Let me see, I have been here
      nearly five months. I stayed two months in the last place. I was nine days
      in San Francisco, one year doing the whole of Europe, and seven months in
      Asia. Yes, decidedly, I must need a change. There are three places left
      for me to try, which one do you advise?" There was a bitter little laugh,
      but her expression was sweet, and her eyes twinkled as she glanced at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad I have three places to choose from," I said. "I was afraid you
      were not going to leave so many as that, and had already begun to plan
      'electric treatment' as a final refuge."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed nervously, but I thought I saw signs of a mental change.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had always found that I could do most with her by falling into her own
      moods of humor or merry satire upon her own condition or upon the various
      stages of medical ignorance and pretence into which we are often driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are these three unhappy places that you have so shamelessly
      neglected? Was it done in malice? I sincerely hope, for their sakes, that
      it was not so bad as that&mdash;that it was a mere oversight on your
      part," I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Australia has been spared my presence so far through malice; the other
      two, through defective theology. I dislike the idea of one of them on
      account of the climate, and of the other, because of the stupid company,"
      she said, with a droll assumption of perplexity; "so, you see, I can't
      even hope for a pleasant change after death. Oh, my case is quite
      hopeless, I assure you, doctor; <i>quite!</i>" She laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had her where I wanted her now. I thought by a little adroitness I might
      get, at least, a part of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are really afraid to die, and yet think that you must," I said,
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her great luminous eyes on me, and her lip curled slightly,
      with real scorn, before she forced upon her face her usual mask of
      good-hum-ored sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid!" she exclaimed, "afraid to die! afraid of what, pray? I cannot
      imagine being afraid to die. It is <i>life</i> I am afraid of. If I could
      only&mdash;" This last passionately. She checked herself abruptly, and
      with an evident effort resumed her usual light air and tone. "But it does
      always seem so absurdly impossible to me, doctor, to hear grownup people
      talk about being afraid to die. It almost surprised me into talking
      seriously, a reprehensive habit I never allow myself. A luxury few can
      afford, you know. It skirts too closely the banks of Tragedy. One is safer
      on the high seas of Frivolity&mdash;don't you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much safer, no doubt, my child," said I, taking her hand, which was
      almost as cold and white as marble; "much safer from those deceived and
      confiding persons who prescribe 'sulph. 12' for the broken heart and
      overwrought nerves of a little woman who tries bravely to fly her gay
      colors in the face of defeat and to whistle a tune at a grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had called late, and we were sitting in the twilight, but I saw tears
      fall on her lap, and she did not withdraw her hand, which trembled
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had touched the wound roughly&mdash;as I had determined to do&mdash;but,
      old man as I was, and used to the sight of suffering as I had been for
      years, I could restrain myself only by an effort from taking her in my
      arms and asking her to forget what I had said. She seemed so utterly
      shaken. We sat for some moment in perfect silence, except for her quick,
      smothered little sobs, and then she said, passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God! doctor, how did you know?" And then, with a flash of fear in
      her voice, "Who told you? No one has talked me over to you? No one has
      written to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing, except what I have seen of your brave fight, my child.
      All the information I have had about you, from outside, was contained in
      that valuable little note of introduction from Griswold."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her tears and agitation she smiled, but looked puzzled, as I
      afterward recalled she always did when I mentioned his name, or spoke as
      if she knew him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not watched you for nothing. And I never treat a patient without
      first diagnosing his case. I do not say that I am <i>always</i> right. I
      am not vain of the methods nor of the progress of my profession; but I am,
      at least, not blind, and I have always been interested in you. I should
      like to help you, if you will let me. I can do nothing for you in the
      dark." Then dropping my voice, significantly: "Does <i>he</i> know where
      you are? Does <i>he</i> know you are ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. I did not know but that she was offended. She
      was struggling for command of her voice, and for courage. Presently she
      said, in a hoarse whisper, which evidently shocked her as much as it
      startled me, so unnatural did it sound:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who? My husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your <i>husband!</i>" I exclaimed. "Are you&mdash;is there&mdash;I did
      not know you were married. Why did you always allow me to call you <i>Miss</i>
      Campbell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," she said, wearily. "It made no difference to me, and it
      seemed to please your fancy to treat me as a child.. But I never really
      noticed that you did always call me Miss. If I had, I should not have
      cared. What difference could it make to me&mdash;or to you&mdash;what
      prefix you put to my name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I did not know you were married," I said almost sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, startled for a moment; but recovering, as from some vague
      suspicion, in an instant she said, smiling a little, and with evident
      relief, plunging into a new opening:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That had nothing to do with my case. There was no need to discuss family
      relations. I never thought of whether <i>you</i> were married or not. You
      were my doctor&mdash;I your patient. What our family relations, wardrobes,
      or political affiliations might be seem to me quite aside from that. We
      may choose to talk of them together, or we may not, as the case may be.
      And in my case, it would not be&mdash;edifying." There was a moment's
      pause, then she said, rather impatiently, but as if the new topic were a
      relief to her: "The idea that a woman must be ticketed as married or
      unmarried, to every chance acquaintance, is repellent to me. Men are not
      so ticketed&mdash;and that is right. It is vulgar to suppose a sign is
      needed to prevent trespass, or to tempt approach. 'Miss Jones, this is Mr.
      Smith.' What does it tell?" She was talking very rapidly now&mdash;nervously.
      "It tells her, 'Here is a gentleman to whom I wish to introduce you. If
      you find him agreeable you will doubtless learn more of him later on.' It
      tells him, 'Here is a lady. <i>She is not married.</i> Her family
      relations&mdash;her most private affairs&mdash;are thrust in his face
      before she has even said good evening to him. I think it is vulgar, and it
      is certainly an unnecessary personality. What his or her marital relations
      may be would seem to come a good deal later in the stage of acquaintance,
      don't you think so, doctor?" She laughed, but it was not like herself.
      Even the laugh had changed. She was fighting for time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a new idea to me," I said, "and I confess I like it. Come to think
      of it, it <i>is</i> a trifle premature&mdash;this thrusting a title
      intended to indicate private relations onto a name used on all public
      occasions. By Jove! it is absurd. I never thought of it before; but it is
      <i>never</i> done with men, is it? 'General,' 'Mr.' 'Dr.'&mdash;none of
      them. All relate to him as an individual, leaving vast fields of
      possibilities all about him. 'Mrs.' 'Miss'&mdash;they tell one thing, and
      one only. That is of a private nature&mdash;a personal association. You
      have started me on a new line of thought, and," said I, taking her hand
      again, "you have given me so much that is new to think of to-night that I
      will go home to look over the budget. You are tired out. Go to bed now.
      Order your tea brought up. Here is an order to see to anything you may
      ask, promptly. Beesley, the manager, is an old friend of mine. Any order
      you may give, if you send it down with this note from me, will be obeyed
      at once. I shall come to-morrow. Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      I put the order on the table, at her side. I know my voice was husky. It
      startled me, as I heard it. She sat perfectly still, but she laid her
      other hand on top of mine, with a light pressure, and her voice sounded
      tired and full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night. You are very kind&mdash;very thoughtful. I will be brave
      to-morrow. Good-night." That night I drove past and saw a light in her
      window at one o'clock. "Poor child!" I said; "will she be brave enough to
      tell me to-morrow, or will she die with her burden, and her gay little
      laugh on her lips?"

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day I called earlier than usual. I had spent an almost sleepless
      night, wondering what I could do for this beautiful, lovable woman, who
      seemed to be all alone in the world, and who evidently felt that she must
      remain apart and desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had caused her to leave her husband? Or had he left her? What for?
      What kind of a man was he? Did she love him, and was she breaking her
      heart for him? or did he stand between her and some other love? Had she
      married young, and made a mistake that was eating her life out? Whose
      fault was it? How could I help her?
    </p>
    <p>
      All these and a thousand other questions forced themselves upon me, and
      none of the answers came to fit the case. Answers there were in plenty,
      but they were not for these questions nor for this woman&mdash;not for
      this delicate flower of her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stepped into the hotel office to send my card to "Parlor 13," as was
      my custom, the clerk looked up with his perfunctory smile and said, "Go'
      morning, doctor. Got so in the habit 'coming here lately, s'pose it'll
      take quite a while to taper off. That about the size of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at the young man in utter bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha! I believe you'd really forgot already she'd gone;" and then,
      with a quick flash of surprise and intelligent, detective shrewdness, "You
      knew she was going, doctor? She did not skip her little bill, did she? Of
      course not. Her husband was in such a deuce of a hurry to catch the early
      train, the night-clerk said he was ringing his bell the blessed night for
      fear they'd get left. Front! take water to 273. You hadn't been gone five
      minutes last night, when he came skipping down here with your check and
      order, and we just had to make things hum to get cash enough together to
      meet it for her; but we made it, and so they got off all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got my check here yet?" asked I, in in a tone that arrested the
      attention of the other clerk, who looked up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! no. Do you think we're made of ready money, just because
      you are? That check was in the bank and part of the cash in that desk the
      first thing after banking hours," said he, opening out the register and
      reaching for a bunch of pens behind him. "You see it cleaned us out last
      night. I couldn't change two dollars for a man this morning. I told
      Campbell last night that you must think hotels were run queer, to expect
      us to cash a five-thousand dollar check on five minutes' notice. Couldn't
      'a' done it at all if 't hadn't been pay-night for servants and the rest
      of us. We all had to wait till to-day. But the old man'll tell you. Here
      he comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, hello! doctor, old boy," said Beesley, coming up from behind and
      clapping me vigorously on the shoulder. "Didn't expect to see the light of
      your countenance around here again so soon. Thought we owed it all to your
      professional ardor for that charming patient of yours up in 13. They got
      off all right, but if any other man but you had sent that order and check
      down here for us to cash last night I'd have told him to make tracks. Of
      course, I understood that they were called away suddenly&mdash;unexpectedly,
      and all that. He told me all about it, and that you did not finish the
      trade till the last minute; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Trade?</i>" gasped I, in spite of my determination to hear all before
      disclosing anything. "Trade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come off. Don't be so consumedly skittish about the use of English, I
      suppose you want me to say that the 'transaction between you was not
      concluded,' etc., etc. Oh, you're a droll one, doctor." He appeared to
      notice a change on my face, which he evidently misconstrued, and he added,
      gayly. "Oh, it was all right, my boy, as long as it was you&mdash;glad to
      do you a good turn any day; but what a queer idea for that little woman to
      marry such a man! How did it happen? I'd like to know the history! Every
      time I saw him come swelling around I made up mind to ask you about them,
      and then I always forgot it when I saw you. When he told me you had been
      his wife's guardian I thought some of kicking you the next good chance I
      got, for allowing the match, and for not telling me you had such a pretty
      ward. You always were a deep rascal&mdash;go off!" He rattled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times I had decided to speak, but as often restrained myself. My
      blank face and unsettled manner appeared to touch his sense of humor. He
      concluded that it was good acting. I decided to confirm the mistake, until
      I had time to think it all over. Finally, I said, as carelessly as I
      could:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long had this&mdash;a&mdash;husband been here? That is&mdash;when did
      he get back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been here! get back! Been here all the time; smoked more good cigars and
      surrounded more wine than any other one man in the house. Oh, he was a
      Jim-dandy of a fellow for a hotel!" Then, with sudden suspicion: "Why? Had
      he told you he'd go away before? Oh! I&mdash;see! <i>That</i> was the
      trade? Paid him to skip, hey? M&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;yes! I think I begin
      to catch on." He could hardly restrain his mirth, and winked at me in
      sheer ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went slowly out. When I arrived at the house I directed the servant to
      say to anyone who might call that the doctor was not at home. I went to my
      room and wrote to Dr. Griswold, asking him for information about Florence
      Campbell, the fair patient he had sent me. "Who was she? What did he know
      of her? Where were her friends?" I told him nothing of this last
      development, but asked for an immediately reply, adding&mdash;"for an
      important reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later a telegram was handed to me as I drove up to my office.
      It was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never heard of her. Why? Griswold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not sleep that night. For the first time my faith in Florence
      Campbell wavered. Up to that time I had blamed her husband for everything.
      I had woven around her a web of plausible circumstances which made her the
      unwilling victim of a designing villain&mdash;an expert forger, no doubt,
      who used her, without her own knowledge, as a decoy&mdash;a man of whom
      she was both ashamed and afraid, but from whom she could not escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was all that to be reconciled with this revelation? Griswold did
      not know her. How about his introduction and that "sulph. 12"? I looked
      through my desk for Griswold's note. It was certainly his handwriting; but
      I noticed, for the first time, that it did not mention her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this was a loop-hole through which I might bring my fair patient&mdash;in
      whom I was beginning to fear I had taken too deep an interest&mdash;without
      discredit to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Might she not have changed her name since Griswold treated her? I
      determined to give her the benefit of this doubt until I could be sure
      that it had no foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt relieved by this respite, and, heartily ashamed of the unjust
      suspicion of the moment before, I gave no hint of it in the letter I now
      wrote Griswold, describing the lady, and in which I enclosed his letter of
      introduction to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days I went about my practice in a dream, and it was no doubt
      due to fortuitous circumstances rather than to my skill that several of my
      patients still live to tell the tale of their suffering and of my
      phenomenal ability to cope with disease in all its malignant power.

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In due time Griswold's letter came. I went into my office to read it. I
      told myself that I had no fears for the good name of Florence Campbell. I
      knew that some explanation would be made that would confirm me in my
      opinion of her; but, for all that, I locked the door, and my hand was less
      steady than I liked to see it, as I tore the end of the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I even remember thinking vaguely that I usually took time to open my
      letters with more precision and with less disregard for the untidy
      appearance of their outer covering afterward. I hesitated to read beyond
      the first line, although I had so hastened to get that far. I read: "My
      dear old friend," and then turned the letter over to see how long it was&mdash;how
      much probable information it contained. There were four closely written
      pages. I wondered if it could all be about Florence Campbell, and was
      vaguely afraid that it was&mdash;and that it was <i>not</i>. I remembered
      looking at the clock when I came into the office. It was nearly six
      o'clock. I laid the letter down and went to the cooler and got out a
      bottle of Vichy. I sat it and (placed) some wine by my elbow on the desk,
      and took up the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of anyone by the name of Florence Campbell, so far as I can
      recall. I certainly never had a patient by that name. Some months ago I
      gave the letter you enclose&mdash;which I certainly did write&mdash;to a
      patient of mine who was on her way to Europe and expected to stay some
      time in New York on her way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She, however, was in no way like the lady you describe. Her name was
      Kittie Hatfield, and she was small, with dreamy blue eyes and flaxen hair&mdash;a
      <i>perfect</i> woman, in fact." Oh! Tom! Tom! thought I&mdash;true to your
      record, to the last! I had long since ceased to wonder at the lapse,
      however, for Florence Campbell herself was surely sufficient explanation
      of all that. "I understood"&mdash;the letter went on&mdash;"that Kittie
      did not stop but a few days in New York, when she was joined by the party
      with which she was to travel. She stayed at the F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Avenue Hotel, I have learned, and became intimate with some queer people
      there&mdash;much to the indignation of her brother, when he learned of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid the letter down and put my head on my arms, folded as they were on
      the desk. I was dizzy and tired. When I raised my head it was dark. I got
      up, lighted the gas, and found myself stiff and as if I had been long in a
      forced and unnatural position. I recalled that I had been indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brother of the silly-pated, blue-eyed girl had not liked her to know
      Florence Campbell, indeed! He was, no doubt, a precious fool&mdash;naturally
      would be, with such a sister, I commented mentally. What else, I wondered,
      had Griswold found out? Was the rest of this old fool's letter about her?
      I began where I had left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have since learned from him that the man&mdash;whose name <i>was</i>
      Campbell&mdash;was a foreigner of some kind, with a decidedly vague, not
      to say, hazy reputation, and that his wife, who was supposed to be an
      invalid, and an American of good family, never appeared in public, and so
      was never seen by him&mdash;that is by Will Hatfield&mdash;but was only
      known to him through Kittie's enraptured eyes. She was said to be bright
      and pretty. Kittie is the most generous child alive in her estimate of
      other women; however, he thinks it possible that Kittie either gave her
      the letter from me to you, and asked her to have proper medical care, or
      else that the woman, or her husband, got hold of it in a less legitimate
      way; which I think quite likely. Kittie thought the Campbell woman was
      charming." The "Campbell woman," indeed! I felt like a thief, even to read
      such rubbish, and I should have enjoyed throttling the whole ill-natured
      gossipping set&mdash;not omitting flaxen-haired Kittie herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to finish the letter, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hatfield is so ashamed of his sister's friendship for the woman that I
      had the utmost difficulty in making him tell me the whole truth, but, from
      what I gathered yesterday, he thinks them most likely the head of a gang
      of counterfeiters or forgers and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I read no further, or, if I did, I can recall only that. It was burned
      into my brain, and when a loud pounding on my office-door aroused me, I
      found the letter twisted and torn into a hundred pieces, the Vichy and
      wine-bottles at my side half-empty, and the hands of the clock pointing to
      half-past ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, doctor," called my lackey; "oh, doctor! Oh, lord, I'm afraid
      something's wrong with the doctor, but I'm afraid to break in the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the door to prevent a scene. One of my best patients stood
      there, with Morgan, the man. Both of them were pale and full of suppressed
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens and earth, doctor, we were afraid you were dead. I've been
      waiting here a good hour for you to come home. No one knew you were in,
      till Morgan peeped over the transom. What in the devil is the matter?"
      said my patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired out, went to sleep," said I; but I did not know my own voice as I
      spoke. It sounded distant, and its tones were strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both looked at me suspiciously, and with evident anxiety as to my
      mental condition. I caught at the means of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am too tired to see anyone to-night. In fact, I am not well. You will
      have to let me off this time. Get Dr. Talbott, next door, if anyone is
      sick; I am going to bed. Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Then he said, wearily: "You are a young man,
      doctor. You have taken the chair I left vacant at the college. I would
      never have told the story to you, perhaps, only I wanted you to know why I
      left the class in your care so suddenly this morning, when I uncovered the
      beautiful face of the 'subject' you had brought from the morgue for me to
      give my closing lecture upon. That class of shallow-pated fellows have not
      learned yet that doctors&mdash;even old fellows like me&mdash;know a good
      deal less than they think they do about the human race&mdash;themselves
      included."
    </p>
    <p>
      I stammered some explanation of the circumstances, and again there was a
      long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found drowned, was she? Poor girl! Do you believe, with that face, she
      was ever a bad woman? Or that she had anything to do with the rascality of
      her husband, even if he were consciously a rascal? and who is to judge of
      that, knowing so little of him? Did I ever recover the five thousand
      dollars? Did I attempt to recover it? Oh, no. All this happened nearly ten
      years ago now; and if that were all it had cost me I should not mind. The
      hotel people never knew. Why should they? This is the first time I have
      told the story. You think I am an old fool? Well, well, perhaps I am&mdash;perhaps
      I am; who can say what any of us are, or what we are not? Thirty years ago
      I knew that I understood myself and everybody else perfectly. To-day I
      know equally well that I understand neither the one nor the other. We
      learn that fact, and then we die&mdash;and that is about all we do learn.
      You wonder, after what I tell you, if the beautiful face at the
      demonstration class this morning was really hers, or whether a strong
      likeness led my eyes and nerves astray You wonder if she drowned herself,
      and why? Was it an accident? Did <i>he</i> do it? This last will be
      decided by each one according as he judges of Florence Campbell and her
      husband&mdash;of who and what they were. Perhaps I shall try to find him
      now. Not for the money, but to learn why she married the man he seemed to
      be. It is hard to tell what I should learn. It is not even easy to know
      just what I should <i>like</i> to learn; and perhaps, after all, it is
      better not to know more&mdash;who shall say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the doctor bade me good-night and bowed himself out to his carriage
      with his old courtesy, and left me alone with the strange, sad story of
      the beautiful girl whose lifeless form had furnished the subject of my
      first lecture to a class of medical students.

    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps I may have told you before, that at the time of which I speak, my
      Summer home&mdash;where I preferred to spend much more than half of the
      year&mdash;was on a sandy beach a few miles out of New York, and also that
      I had retired from active practice as a physician, even when I was in the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding these two facts, I was often called in consultation, both
      in and out of the city; and was occasionally compelled to take a case
      entirely into my own hands, through some accident or unforeseen
      circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of these accidents which brought the patient whose story I am
      about to tell you, under my care.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can hardly say now, why I retained the case instead of turning it over
      to some brother practitioner, as was my almost invariable habit; but for
      some reason I kept it in my own hands, and, as it was the only one for
      which I was solely responsible at the time, I naturally took more than
      ordinary interest in and paid more than usual attention to all that seemed
      to me to bear upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you know I am an "old school" or "regular" physician, although that did
      not prevent me from consulting with, and appreciating the strong points of
      many of those who were of other, and younger branches of the profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      This peculiarity had subjected me, in times gone by, to much adverse
      criticism from some of my colleagues who belonged to that rigidly orthodox
      faction which appears to feel that it is a much better thing to allow a
      patient to die "regularly"&mdash;as it were&mdash;than it is to join
      forces with one, who, being of us, is still not with us in theory and
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing that we were all purblind at best, and that there was and
      still is, much to learn in every department of medicine, it did not always
      seem to me that it was absolutely necessary to reject, without due
      consideration, the guesses of other earnest and careful men, even though
      they might differ from me in the prefix to the "pathy" which forms the
      basis of the conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all wrong so often that it has never appeared to be a matter of the
      first importance&mdash;it does not present itself to my mind as absolutely
      imperative&mdash;that it should be invariably the same wrong, or that all
      of the mistakes should necessarily follow the beaten track of the "old
      school."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had arrived at that state of beatitude where I was not unwilling for a
      life to be saved&mdash;or even for pain to be alleviated, by other methods
      than my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not pretend that this exalted ethical status came to me all at once,
      nor at a very early stage of my career; but it came, and I had reaped the
      whirlwind of wrath, as I have just hinted to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when my patient let me know, after a time, that he had been used to
      homeopathic treatment, I at once suggested that he send for some one of
      that school to take charge of his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declined&mdash;somewhat reluctantly, I thought, still, quite
      positively. But, in the course of events, when I felt that a consultation
      was due to him as well as to myself, I asked him if he would not prefer
      that the consulting physician should be of that school.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admitted that he would, and I assured him that I should be pleased to
      send for any one he might name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew no doctor here, he said, and left it to me to send for the one in
      whom I had the greatest confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at this point my story really begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped on my way uptown to arrange, with Dr. Hamilton, of Madison
      Avenue, a consultation that afternoon, at three o'clock. I told the doctor
      all that I, myself, knew at that time, of my patient's history. Three
      weeks before I had been in a Fifth Avenue stage; a gentleman had politely
      arisen to offer his seat to a lady at the moment that the stage gave a
      sudden lurch which threw them both violently against each other and
      against the end of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke the fall for her; but he received a blow on the head, which
      member came in contact with the money-box, with a sharp crack. Accustomed
      to the sight of pain and suffering as I was, the sound of the blow and his
      suddenly livid face gave me a feeling of sickness which did not wholly
      leave me for an hour afterward. Involuntarily I caught him in my arms&mdash;he
      was a slightly built man&mdash;and directed the driver to stop at the
      first hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was unconscious and I feared he had sustained a serious
      fracture of the skull. He was evidently a man of culture, and I thought
      not an American. I therefore wished, if possible, to save him a police or
      hospital experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking him into the first hotel I reasoned, we could examine him; learn
      who and what he was, where he lived, and, after reviving him, send him
      home in a carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of bringing him back to consciousness was slow, and as the
      papers on his person, which we felt at liberty to examine, gave no clue to
      his residence, we concluded to put him to bed and trust to farther
      developments to show us what to do in the matter of removal. The lady on
      whose account he had received the injury had given me her card, which bore
      a name well known on the Avenue, and had stated that she would, if
      necessary, be responsible for all expense at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was deemed best, therefore, to put him to bed, as I said before, and
      wait for him to indicate, for himself, the next move. I placed in the safe
      of the hotel his pocketbook, which contained a large sum of money (large
      that is, for a man to carry on his person in these days of cheques and
      exchanges) and his watch, which was a handsome one, with this inscription
      on the inside cover, "T. C. from Florence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cards in his pocket bore different names and addresses, mostly
      foreign, but the ones I took for his own were finely engraved, and read
      "Mr. T. C. Lathro," nothing more. No address, no business; simply calling
      cards, of a fashionable size, and of the finest quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, as I say, was about three weeks before I concluded to call Dr.
      Hamilton in consultation; and I had really learned very little more of my
      patient's affairs than these facts taken from his pocket that first day
      while he was still unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent about himself, and while he had slowly grown better his
      progress toward health did not satisfy me, nor do I think that he was
      wholly of opinion, that I was doing quite all that should be done to
      hasten his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always courteous, self-poised, and able to bear pain bravely; but I
      thought he watched me narrowly, and I several times detected him in a
      weary sigh and an impatient movement of the eyebrows, which did not tally
      with his assumption of cheerful indifference and hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use the word hospitality advisedly, for his effort always seemed to be
      to treat me as a guest whom he must entertain, and distract from observing
      his ailments, rather than as a physician whose business it was to discover
      and remedy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had declined to be moved; said he was a stranger; had no preferences as
      to hotels; felt sure this one was as comfortable as any; thanked me over
      and over for having taken him there, and changed the subject. He would
      talk as long as I would allow him on any subject, airily, brightly,
      readily. On any subject, that is, except himself; yet from his
      conversation I had gathered that he had travelled a great deal; was a man
      of wealth and culture, whether French, Italian or Russian, I could not
      decide. He spoke all of these languages, and words from each fitted easily
      into place when for a better English one, he hesitated or was at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he seemed to have seen much of every country and to have observed
      impartially&mdash;without national prejudice. He knew men well, too well
      to praise recklessly; and he sometimes gave me the impression, I can
      hardly say how, that blame was a word whose meaning he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of having seen deeds of the most appalling nature in Russia, and
      talked of their perpetrators sometimes, as good and brave men. He never
      appeared to measure men by their exceptional acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally I contested these points with him, and I am not sure but that
      it may have been the interest I took in his conversation that held me as
      his physician; for as I said, I was well aware that he did not improve as
      he should have done after the first few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I liked to hear him talk. He was a revelation to me. I greatly enjoyed
      his breath and charity&mdash;if I may so express the mental attitude which
      recognized neither the possession of, nor the need for, either quality in
      his judgments of his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had evidently not been able to pass through life under the impression
      that character, like cloth, is cut to fit a certain outline, and that
      after the basting-threads are once in, no farther variation need be looked
      for. Indeed, I question if he would have been able to comprehend the
      mental condition of those grown-up "educated" children who are never able
      to outgrow the comfortable belief that words and acts have a definite,
      inflexible, par-value&mdash;that an unabridged dictionary, so to speak, is
      an infallible appeal; who, in short, expect their villains to be
      consistently and invariably villainous, in the regulation orthodox
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual shades of meaning, whether of language or of character, do not
      enter into their simple philosophy. Mankind suffers, in their pennyweight
      scales, a shrinkage that is none the less real because they never suspect
      that the dwarfage may be due to themselves&mdash;to their system of
      weights and measures. All variations from their standard indicate an
      unvarying tendency to mendacity. He whom they once detect in a quibble, or
      in an attempt to acquire the large end of a bargain, never recovers (what
      is perhaps only his rightful heritage, in spite of an occasional lapse)
      the respect and confidence of these primer students who are inflexible
      judges of all mental and moral manifestations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat that this comfortable and regular philosophy was foreign to my
      patient's mental habits, and I began to consider, the more I talked with
      him, that it did not agree with my own personal observations. I reflected
      that I was not very greatly surprised, nor did I lose faith in a man
      necessarily, when I discovered him in a single mean or questionable
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, then, should I be surprised to find those of whom I had known only
      ill-engaged in deeds of the most unselfish nature? Deeds of heroism and
      generosity such as he often recounted as a part of the life of some of
      these same terrible Russian officials. There seems, however, to be that in
      us which finds it far easier to reconcile a single mean or immoral action
      with an otherwise upright life, than to believe it likely, or even
      possible, for a depraved nature to perform, upon occasion, deeds of
      exalted or unusual purity. Yet so common is the latter, that its failure
      of recognition by humanity in general can be due it seems to me, only to a
      wrong teaching or to a stupidity beyond even normal bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, after all, the bad man who is all bad, is really a less frequent
      product than that much talked of, but rare creature, a perfect woman.
      Perhaps one could count the specimens of either of these to be met with in
      a life time, on the fingers of one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to my patient and his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of these things that he and I had often talked, and I had come to
      greatly respect the self-poise and acute observation, as well as the broad
      human sympathy of this reserved and evidently sad-hearted man. Sad-hearted
      I knew, in spite of his keen sense of humor, and his firm grasp of
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave Dr. Hamilton a brief outline of all this, as well as of the
      physical condition of the man whom he was to see; for I believe it to be
      quite as important for a physician to understand and diagnose the mental
      as the physical conditions of those who come under his care before he can
      prescribe intelligently for other than very trifling ailments.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can imagine my surprise when I tell you that the moment Dr. Hamilton
      stepped into the room, and I mentioned his name, my patient, this
      self-poised man of the world, whose nerves had often seemed to me to be of
      tempered steel, looked up suddenly as you have seen a timid child do when
      it is sharply reproved, and fainted dead away.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I confess that I expected a scene.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I glanced at the doctor, but he showed no sign of ever having seen my
      patient before, and went to work with me in the most methodical and
      indifferent way possible to revive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not mention that this was one of his symptoms&mdash;a peculiarity
      of his. Has he been subject to this sort of thing? Did he say he was
      subject to it before he hurt his head, or has it developed since?" the
      doctor inquired quietly as we worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bit my lip. His tone was so exasperatingly cool, while, knowing my
      patient as I did, his startled manner and sudden fainting had impressed me
      deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the first time," I said, "since he was hurt&mdash;that is, since he
      recovered consciousness after the blow&mdash;that he has exhibited the
      slightest tendency to anything of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated, then I said: "Doctor, if you know him; if this is the result
      of seeing you suddenly (for he did not know who was to come) don't you
      think&mdash;would it be well?&mdash;Do you think it best for you to be
      where he will see you when he begins to revive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stared at me, then at my patient. "I don't know him&mdash;never
      saw him before in my life so far as I know. What did you say his name is?
      Mum&mdash;oh, yes, Lathro&mdash;first and only time I ever heard it. Oh,
      no, I suppose his nerves are weak. The excitement of seeing me&mdash;the
      idea of&mdash;a&mdash;er&mdash;consultation." I smiled, involuntarily.
      "You don't know the man, doctor," said I. "He is bomb proof as to nerves
      in that sense of the word. He&mdash;a&mdash;There must be some other
      reason. He must have mistaken you for some one else. I am sorry to trouble
      you, doctor, but would you kindly step into the other room? He will open
      his eyes now, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      When, a moment later, my patient regained consciousuess, he glanced about
      him furtively, like a hunted man. He did not look like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined my face closely&mdash;suspiciously, I thought&mdash;for a
      moment. Then I laughed lightly, and said: "Well, old fellow, you've been
      trying your hand at a faint. That's a pretty way to treat a friend. I come
      in to see you; you step out to nobody knows where&mdash;to no man's land&mdash;and
      give me no end of trouble rowing you back to our shore. What did you eat
      for dinner that served you that kind of a trick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked all about the room again, examined my face, and then smiled, for
      the first time since I had known him, nervously, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think my digestion must be pretty badly out of order. I'll declare I
      saw double when you came in. I thought there were two of you; and the
      other one&mdash;wasn't you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed; "That is good. Two of me, but the other one wasn't me. Well,
      thank heaven there is only one of me up to date."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, but seemed disturbed still. I decided to ask him a direct
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well now, just suppose there had been two of me&mdash;is that an excuse
      for you to faint? Does associating with one of me try you to that extent
      that two of me would prostrate you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not take me up with his old manner. He was listless and absent. I
      said that I would go down to the office and order some wine and return at
      once. I slipped into the other room, and with my finger on my lips
      motioned to Dr. Hamilton to pass out quietly before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed him. "There is something wrong, Doctor," I said: "I am sorry,
      but I shall have to ask you to go without seeing him again. I can't tell
      you why yet, but I'll try to find out and let you know. Order some
      champagne sent up to me, please, as you go out, and I will see you as soon
      as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I re-entered the room, my patient, whose restless eyes met mine
      as I opened the door, said: "I thought you were talking to some one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was," said I carelessly; a bell-boy, "I ordered wine. It will be up
      soon." Then I changed the subject; but he was nervous and unlike himself
      and none of the old topics interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door opened for the boy with the wine an expression of actual
      terror passed over my patient's face. When I left him a half hour later I
      was puzzled and anxious.
    </p>

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment I entered his room on the following day he said: "I thought you
      had planned to have another doctor come and look me over, yesterday." He
      was watching me closely as he spoke: "Did I hear you mention his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, thought I, here <i>is</i> a mystery in spite of Dr. Hamilton's denial.
      I will try him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I said, "I had decided to ask the best Homeopathic doctor I know, a
      skilful man, especially successful in diagnosing cases, to overhaul you
      and see if he agrees with me that you ought to be on your feet this
      blessed minute, if my diagnosis of your case is entirely right. I don't
      see why you are still so weak. He may find the spring that I have missed.
      Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you&mdash;I am not acquainted with the doctors here,&mdash;I think
      you said his name is&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not mentioned his name to you," I said, "but the one I had in mind
      is Dr. Hamilton of&mdash;&mdash; Madison Avenue."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about it, the color rose slowly to his face, and he was
      struggling for self-control. At length he said: "No, I do not wish to see
      another doctor. I am perfectly satisfied with you. I am&mdash;I say&mdash;no,
      positively do not ask him; that is, do not ask anyone to come unless I
      know and definitely agree to it. And I certainly shall want to know who he
      is first."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was wholly foreign to the man, to his nature and habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," I said, "what you have against Dr. Hamilton, for I cannot fail
      to see that there is something behind all this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply for some time; then he said wearily, but with great depth
      of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I may as well tell you. I cannot forgive him for an injury I
      did him long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not say anything nor did I look at him. Presently he went on
      hoarsely; "If I had only injured him, perhaps I could get over it but I
      took a mean advantage of&mdash;I did it through a woman who liked him&mdash;and
      whom he&mdash;loved and trusted." There was another long silence; then I
      said; "You were right to tell me, Lathro. You need not fear that I will
      betray you to him, and he does not know you. He did not recognize you
      either before or after you fainted. Of course I knew there was something
      wrong. He will not come again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet, and a wave of red surged into his face. "I knew it!
      I knew I had seen him! I was sure it was not a delusion," he said. "He was
      here. No, he would not know me. He never saw me. I did not injure him like
      a man, I struck from behind a woman. A woman who cared for his respect,
      and I let him blame her. I suppose I could get over it if it were not for
      that. I came back here partly to let him know, if I could some way, that
      she was not to blame"&mdash;there was another long silence&mdash;"and
      partly to get rid of myself. Russia did not do it,&mdash;Turkey,&mdash;France&mdash;none
      of them. I thought perhaps he would&mdash;I had some sort of a wild idea
      that he might settle with me some way. I have carried that forged cheque
      in my brain, until&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I started visibly. I had had no idea that it was so bad as this. I changed
      my position to hide or cover the involuntary movement I had made, but he
      had seen it and the color died out of his face. He forced himself to begin
      again. "I carried that forged check," he was articulating now with
      horrible distinctness, "wherever I went. She never knew anything about it.
      She knew I was&mdash;she thought, or feared, that I might be somewhat&mdash;what
      you Americans call crooked; but she did not know the truth, not until the
      very last. She knew that I had been unreliable in some ways long ago; but
      she did not dream of the worst. At last,&mdash;sometimes I think I was a
      fool to have done it,&mdash;but I told her. I told her the whole truth,
      and&mdash;she left me. She had borne everything till then. I think she
      came here. Before long I followed. She told me not to, and I said I would
      not; but of course I did. I could not help it. I knew then, and I know
      now, that I am putting myself into the clutches of the law; but I do not
      care&mdash;not now&mdash; since I cannot find Florence Campbell."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pronounced the name as if it were a treasure wrung from him by force.
      "It is the only really criminal thing I ever did. I do not know why I did
      it. They say that crime&mdash;a taste for it, develops slowly, by degrees.
      Maybe so; but not with me, not with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had money enough; but&mdash;oh, my God! how I hated him. I saw that he
      was growing to love her without knowing it. I often heard them talking
      together. They did not know it, and if they had it could not have been
      more innocent; but I was madly jealous, for the first time in my life. I
      determined to make him think ill of her, and yet I said just now that
      forgery was my only crime. That was worse, by far, but I believe it is not
      a crime in law."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled scornfully. "I have outgrown all that now. The storm has left me
      the wreck you see; but I thought it all out last night, and determined to
      tell you. You are to tell&mdash;him&mdash;for her sake," he said between
      his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may see her yet some day. She will never return to me&mdash;God bless
      her! God help us both!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she will never return to you nor to anyone else," I said, as gently
      as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up with the energy of a maniac. "How do you know? What do you
      know?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only know that she is dead, my friend," I said, placing my hand on his
      arm, "and that Dr. Hamilton does not wish to punish you. I heard it all;
      the story of the forgery of his name, and that a Florence Campbell was in
      some way connected with it. I heard it from him long, long ago; but he
      does not know that you are Tom Campbell. You are safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does not wish to punish me! I am safe! Great God, no one could punish me.
      I do that. Safe! Oh, the irony of language!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. He had gone to the window and was staring out into
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the sound of convulsive sobbing filled the room; I thought best
      to remain near the door and make no effort to check his grief with words.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the storm spent itself. He came slowly into the middle of the room
      and stood facing me. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the greatest punishments is gone, thank God. Florence Campbell is
      dead, you say. Do you know what it is, Doctor, to wish that one you loved
      was dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes." I said; "but it is best for you not to talk any more&mdash;nor
      think, just now&mdash;not of that&mdash;not of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke in impatiently&mdash;"Don't you know me well enough yet to know
      that that sort of thing&mdash;that sort of professional humbug is useless?
      Must not talk more of that&mdash;nor think of it, indeed! What else do you
      suppose I ever think of? The good men who are bad and the bad ones who are
      good&mdash;the puppets of our recent conversations? Suppose we boil it
      down a little. Am I a bad man? That is a question that puzzles me. Am I a
      good one? At least I can answer <i>that</i>&mdash;and yet I never did but
      one criminal deed in my whole life, and I have done a great many so-called
      good ones to set over against it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you can answer neither question with a single word," I said. He took
      my hand and pressed it with the frenzy of a new hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least one man's philosophy is not all words," he said. "You act upon
      your theories. You are the only one I ever knew who did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I am the only one you ever gave the chance," I replied, still
      holding his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood thus silent for a moment, then he said with an inexpressible
      accent of satire: "Would you advise me to try it, doctor, with anyone
      else?" I deliberated some time before I replied. Then I said: "No, I am
      sorry to say that I fear it would not be safe. There is still so much
      tiger in the human race. No, do not tell your story again to any one; it
      can do no good. Most certainly I would advise you <i>not</i> to try it
      ever again."
    </p>
    <p>
      As I left the room he said: "True, true. It can do no good, none
      whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he left. I never saw him again. Two years later I received a
      kind letter from him in which he greatly over-estimated all I had done for
      him. The letter came from St. Petersburg and was signed "T. Lathro
      Campbell, Col. Imperial Guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied, in spite of his letter, that he would rather sever all
      connection with this country, and feel that he had no ties nor past; so I
      never answered his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I wonder if he misunderstood my silence, and accepted it as a
      token of unfriendliness&mdash;and yet&mdash;well, I have never been able
      to decide just what would be least painful to him; so I let it drift into
      years of silence, and perhaps, after all, these very good intentions of
      mine may be only cobble-stones added to the paving of the streets of a
      certain dread, but very populous city which is, in these days of
      agnosticism quite a matter of jest in polite society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who shall say? Which would he prefer, friendly communication or silence
      and forgetfulness?
    </p>
    <p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
